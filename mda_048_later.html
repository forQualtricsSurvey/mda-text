<p>Operating Expenses:<br>
 <br>
Total operating expenses decreased $28.9 million, or 16%, to $157.1 million in 2015 from $186.0 million in 2014, due primarily to the reduction in the value of inventory recognized in 2014, which did not recur during 2015, and lower depreciation expense.<br>
 <br>
Cost of Services<br>
 <br>
Cost of services increased $0.9 million, or 3%, to $30.6 million in 2015 from $29.7 million in 2014. The Thales in-orbit support contract signed in the fourth quarter of 2014 contributed $0.7 million to this increase. Research and development costs related to new products were also higher in 2015. These increases were offset partially by decreases from the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on contracts, personnel costs and other expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies. We also recognized a decrease in third party costs. As mentioned above in other service revenue, while we were manufacturing and deploying our second-generation constellation, we began purchasing service from other satellite providers that we re-sell to certain loyal customers. We record these costs in other cost of services as third party costs. In markets where our coverage is fully restored, we have transitioned most of these subscribers to our network; therefore, the costs have decreased.<br>
 <br>
Cost of Subscriber Equipment Sales<br>
 <br>
Cost of subscriber equipment sales decreased $3.0 million, or 20%, to $11.8 million in 2015 from $14.9 million in 2014. The decrease in cost of subscriber equipment sales is due to changes in the carrying value, mix, and volume of products sold during the respective years. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded a reduction in the carrying value of Duplex inventory based on evaluating and estimating timing of new product launches.<br>

Cost of Subscriber Equipment Sales - Reduction in the Value of Inventory<br>
 <br>
We recognized no reduction in the value of inventory during 2015 compared to $21.7 million for 2014. The 2014 reduction consisted of the following:</p>

<p>•<br>
During the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded a reduction in the value of inventory of $14.4 million. We recognized these charges after evaluating our Duplex inventory and estimating the timing of new product launches. Our assessment indicated that there was an excess of Duplex equipment included in inventory on hand based on our current sales run-rate.</p>

<p>•<br>
During the second quarter of 2014, we recorded a reduction in the value of inventory of $7.3 million following cancellation of our contract with Qualcomm related to finished goods and raw materials previously accounted for as advances for inventory on our consolidated balance sheet. We cancelled this contract in March 2013, and we entered into an agreement with Qualcomm in July 2014 whereby we paid $0.1 million to Qualcomm for all remaining finished goods and raw materials held at Qualcomm. Our future business plan contemplates using Hughes-based technology in future product development. As a result, much of the raw material held by Qualcomm is not likely to be used in the future production of additional inventory and their value was impaired.<br>
 <br>
Marketing, general and administrative<br>
 <br>
Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased $3.9 million, or 12%, to $37.4 million in 2015 from $33.5 million in 2014. Higher subscriber acquisition costs resulting from enhanced advertising efforts, increased dealer commissions, broader global expansion, and aggressive rebate promotions comprised 50% of the increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses for 2015. We also incurred higher bad debt expense, which constituted 28% of the increase for 2015 due primarily to specific reserves we recorded for certain commercial customer balances. Higher personnel costs, which were driven by an expanded employee base and increased healthcare costs, also contributed to the increase. These increases were offset partially by decreases from the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on contracts, personnel costs and other expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies. Stock compensation expense also decreased $0.4 million primarily related to the vesting of a key employee performance grant during 2014, which did not recur in 2015.</p>

<p>Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion<br>
 <br>
Depreciation, amortization, and accretion expense decreased $8.9 million, or 10%, to $77.2 million in 2015 compared to $86.1 million in 2014. This decrease relates primarily to our ending depreciation of our first-generation satellites launched during 2007, which reached the end of their estimated depreciable lives during 2014.</p>
