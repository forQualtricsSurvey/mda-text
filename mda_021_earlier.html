<p>Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements</p>

<p>We believe that the combination of our cash flows from operations, current cash on hand and the availability under the Company’s credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements and provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our anticipated operating needs for at least the next 12 months. Although operating activities are expected to provide cash, to the extent of significant growth in the future, our operating and investing activities will use cash and, consequently, this growth may require us to access some or all of the availability under the credit facilities. It is also possible, that additional sources of finance may be necessary to support additional growth.</p>

<p>The following summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2013, and the effects such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods:</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>(1)	Estimated interest liability has been calculated using the effective rate for each category of debt over the remaining term of the debt and taking into account scheduled repayments. The revolving line has been assumed to be constant (i.e. $51,550) throughout the remaining term. As noted above in this report, all of our debt is linked to LIBOR rates. The Company has in place an interest rate swap contract that hedges a portion of the Company’s variable rate debt. At December 31, 2013, the notional amount on the interest rate swap contract was $36,750, as compared to outstanding variable rate debt of $51,550 at December 31, 2013. The Company’s interest rate swap contract terminates on December 31, 2014.</p>

<p>There were no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2013.</p>

<p>Under the terms of the credit facility, all debt outstanding is due when the agreement expires on June 17, 2018.</p>

<p>In addition to the above contractual obligations, $1,692 of unrecognized tax liabilities has been recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2013 and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled. Related to the unrecognized tax benefits not included in the table above, we have also recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of $120 as of December 31, 2013.</p>
