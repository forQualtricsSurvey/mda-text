<p>Historical Cash Flows</p>

<p>Our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 are summarized below:</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>Our cash flows from operating activities decreased to $19.7 million in 2013 from $37.1 million in 2012. The decrease in net cash from operating activities in 2013 was due to the impact of lower LME prices on our operating income in 2013 compared to 2012, higher pension and OPEB contributions in 2013 related to the PBGC settlement of approximately $3.5 million and non-recurring costs for corporate relocation in 2013 of approximately $5.8 million. In addition, in 2013, we paid a litigation settlement of $1.6 million; we received an insurance settlement of $7.9 million in 2012. Offsetting these decreases in cash flows, we received approximately $8.1 million in net tax refunds in 2013 versus approximately $13.7 million in net tax payments in 2012.</p>

<p>Our cash flows from operating activities were $37.1 million in 2012 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $2.9 million in 2011. The increase in net cash from operating activities was due to lower net pension and benefits contributions of $14.0 million, lower net income and withholding tax payments in Iceland of $24.4 million, an insurance settlement received in 2012 for $7.9 million, other changes in working capital totaling $18.0 million in the aggregate and non-recurring costs incurred in 2011 associated with the restart of a curtailed potline of $8.6 million. The increase in net cash from operating activities in 2012 was partially offset by the impact of lower LME prices in 2012 compared to 2011.</p>

<p>Our net cash used in investing activities in 2013 was $117.2 million compared to $32.5 million in 2012. The increase in cash used was due to the purchase of the Sebree smelter in 2013, $48.1 million. In addition, increased capital expenditures in 2013 compared to 2012 accounted for an increase of $29.3 million, primarily for the Grundartangi expansion project and Vlissingen restart. Restricted cash deposits were $1.2 million higher in 2013 compared to 2012 and payments received from joint ventures were $6.6 million lower in 2013.</p>

<p>Our net cash used in investing activities in 2012 was $32.5 million compared to $24.9 million in 2011. The increase in cash used was primarily due to the purchase and improvements of Vlissingen for $13.8 million, offset by lower capital expenditures and larger payments received from joint ventures in 2012 and cash inflows in 2011 related to the return of restricted cash deposits of $3.7 million that did not recur in 2012.</p>

<p>Our net cash used in financing activities during 2013 was $2.4 million. The cash used was primarily related to the tender offer, consent solicitation and redemption of our 7.5% Notes due 2014 and issuance of our 7.5% Notes due 2021. The net cost of our long-term debt transactions in 2013 was $8.5 million, offset by net borrowings under our revolving credit facilities of $6.0 million.</p>

<p>Our net cash used in financing activities during 2012 was $4.0 million. The cash used was related to the repurchase of our common stock.</p>

<p>Our net cash used in financing activities during 2011 was $93.1 million. The use was primarily due to the redemption of the 1.75% Notes in May 2011 of $47.1 million and $45.9 million for the repurchase of common stock.</p>
