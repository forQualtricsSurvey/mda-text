<p>Liquidity and Capital Resources<br>
 <br>
Our principal liquidity requirements include paying amounts related to second-generation upgrades to our ground infrastructure, repaying our debt and funding our operating costs. Our principal sources of liquidity include cash on hand, cash flows from operations, funds available under our common stock purchase agreement with Terrapin and funds available under the August 2015 Thermo equity commitment. See below for further discussion. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for a description of risks, some of which are beyond our control, affecting our ability to achieve our liquidity requirements.<br>
Additionally, the Facility Agreement requires us to maintain $37.9 million in a debt service reserve account. The Facility Agreement restricts the use of the funds in this account to making principal and interest payments under the Facility Agreement. As of December 31, 2015, the balance in the debt service reserve account was $37.9 million, which we classified as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets.<br>
 <br>
Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013<br>
 <br>
The following table shows our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities (in thousands):</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>Cash Flows Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities<br>
 <br>
Net cash provided by operating activities during 2015 was $2.2 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities during 2014 of $4.0 million. Compared to 2014, net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $1.8 million due primarily to lower cash receipts for future services to be provided by us to our subscribers and lower cash receipts from the sale of inventory. These activities were offset partially by favorable fluctuations in certain operating assets and liabilities, including accounts payable and accrued expenses, other current assets and non-current liabilities.<br>
 <br>
Net cash provided by operating activities during 2014 was $4.0 million compared to net cash used in operating activities during 2013 of $6.5 million. During 2014, we experienced favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities, which resulted in less cash being used in operating activities. Compared to 2013, net cash provided by (used in) operating activities fluctuated by $10.5 million, which was due primarily to an increase in cash collected from accounts receivable, cash receipts for future services to be provided by us to our subscribers and cash receipts from the sale of inventory.<br>
  <br>
Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities<br>
 <br>
Cash used in investing activities was $33.5 million during 2015 compared to $19.3 million during 2014. The increase in cash used in investing activities of $14.2 million was due primarily to an increase in spending related to our second-generation ground upgrades.</p>

<p>Cash used in investing activities was $19.3 million during 2014 compared to $37.1 million during 2013. The $17.8 million decrease in cash used in investing activities was due primarily to a decrease in costs related to our second-generation constellation. Our payments related to the construction of our second-generation satellites decreased in 2014 as they were deployed fully by August 2013.<br>
 <br>
Cash Flows Provided by Financing Activities<br>
 <br>
Net cash provided by financing activities was $33.3 million in 2015 compared to $5.3 million in 2014. The increase in cash provided by financing activities of $28.0 million during 2015 was due primarily to cash received from the sale of common stock to Terrapin, offset partially by higher principal payments on the Facility Agreement and a reduction in cash received for warrants exercised and other share issuances.</p>

<p>Net cash provided by financing activities was $5.3 million in 2014 compared to $49.0 million in 2013. The $43.7 million decrease in cash provided by financing activities during 2014 was due primarily to net proceeds in 2013 of $25.8 million related to the extinguishment of the 5.75% Notes and the issuance of equity to Thermo in connection with the Consent Agreement and the Common Stock Purchase and Option Agreement. Similar transactions did not recur in 2014. During 2013, we also drew $1.7 million consisting of the remaining amount under our Facility Agreement and the interest earned from amounts held in our contingent equity account. We also received cash for other issuances of shares and through warrants exercised. As a result of these transactions, we received $15.4 million in 2013 and $9.5 million in 2014. We also drew $6.0 million from our common stock purchase agreement with Terrapin in 2013. These decreases in cash provided by financing activities were coupled with the first principal payment pursuant to our Facility Agreement of $4.0 million, which was paid in 2014. See Note 3: Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements in our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these items.</p>
