<p>Recently Issued Accounting Guidance</p>

<p>In February 2013, The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, establishes new requirements for disclosing reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI). Specifically, (1) disclosure is required of the changes in components of accumulated OCI, (2) disclosure is required of the effects on individual line items in net income for each item of accumulated OCI that is reclassified in its entirety to net income, and (3) cross references are required to other disclosures that provide additional details for OCI items that are not reclassified in their entirety to net income. The requirements of ASU 2013-02 apply to all entities (i.e., both public and nonpublic) that report items of OCI in any period presented. ASU 2013-02 is effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012. The Company adopted this standard effective January 1, 2013.</p>

<p>In October 2012, FASB issued ASU No. 2012-04, Technical Corrections and Improvements. This update primarily makes amendments to various Codifications to (1) conform the format and writing style of certain guidance carried forward without modification from pre-Codification pronouncements, (2) to correct references and provide clarification through updated language, and (3) to relocate guidance within the Codification to a more appropriate location. In addition, ASU No. 2012-4 conforms the use of the term fair value throughout the Codification to reflect fully the measurement and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures (e.g. to replace the terms “market value” and “mark-to-market” with “fair value” and “subsequently measure at fair value,” respectively). The majority of the amendments do not change the accounting practice. However, where applicable, the Company has applied the updates.</p>
