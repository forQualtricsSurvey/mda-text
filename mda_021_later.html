<p>Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements</p>

<p>We believe that the combination of our cash flows from operations, current cash on hand and the availability under the Company’s credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements and provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our anticipated operating needs for at least the next 12 months. Although operating activities are expected to provide cash, to the extent of significant growth in the future, our operating and investing activities will use cash and, consequently, this growth may require us to access some or all of the availability under the credit facility. It is also possible that additional sources of finance may be necessary to support additional growth.</p>

<p>The following summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2014, and the effects such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods:</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>(1)	Estimated interest liability has been calculated using the effective rate for each category of debt over the remaining term of the debt and taking into account scheduled repayments. The revolving line has been assumed to be constant (i.e. $99,400) throughout the remaining term. All of our debt is linked to LIBOR rates.</p>

<p>There were no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2014.</p>

<p>Under the terms of the credit facility, all debt outstanding is due when the agreement expires on June 17, 2018.</p>

<p>In addition to the above contractual obligations, $1,958 of unrecognized tax benefits and $215 of accrued penalties and interest have been recorded as long term liabilities as of December 31, 2014. We are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled or any tax benefits may be realized.</p>
