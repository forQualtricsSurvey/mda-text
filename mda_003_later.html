<p>Primary aluminum is a global traded commodity and its price is effectively determined on the LME, plus any regional delivery and value-added product premiums. Because primary aluminum is a global commodity, the price for aluminum can be volatile and subject to many factors beyond our control. This price volatility is influenced primarily by the global supply-demand balance and other factors such as speculative activities by market participants, production activities by competitors and political and economic conditions, as well as production costs in major production regions. Increases or decreases in primary aluminum prices result in increases and decreases in our revenues (assuming all other factors are unchanged). We may enter into forward contracts or other hedging arrangements to mitigate our price risk, but did not hold any such contracts as of December 31, 2014.</p>

<p>The historic volatility of the price of aluminum is reflected in the chart below:</p>

<p>The average LME price for primary aluminum for 2014 was $1,867 per tonne, compared to $1,846 per tonne in 2013. The average regional delivery premiums increased in 2014 to $450 per tonne for the U.S. Midwest premium from $244 per tonne in 2013 and $218 per tonne in 2012. European Duty Paid Premiums showed similar increases.</p>

<p>The LME price of primary aluminum rebounded in 2014 with demand growth driving market deficits, particularly in North America and Europe. The LME aluminum price peaked over $2,100 per tonne in August 2014 before declining to $1,832 as of December 31, 2014. Regional market delivery premiums increased in 2014 to a high of $526 per tonne for the U.S. Midwest premium and $510 per tonne for the European Duty Paid Premium, compared to highs of $267 per tonne and $298 per tonne, respectively for 2013. However, various global macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties have recently pushed the LME price, the U.S. Midwest premium and the European Duty Paid Premium lower.</p>

<p>Our operating results are significantly impacted by changes in the price of primary aluminum and the materials used in its production, including electrical power, alumina, aluminum fluoride and carbon products. Because we sell our products based principally on the LME price for primary aluminum, regional delivery premiums and value-added product premiums, we cannot pass on increased production costs to our customers. Although we attempt to mitigate the effects of price fluctuations from time to time through the use of various fixed-price commitments, financial instruments and also by negotiating LME-based pricing in some of our raw materials and electrical power contracts, these efforts also limit our ability to take advantage of favorable changes in the market prices for primary aluminum or raw materials and may affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.</p>

<p>Shipment volume is another of our key performance indicators. In normal circumstances, our facilities operate at or near capacity, and fluctuations in volume, other than through curtailments, acquisitions or expansion, generally are small. The production of primary aluminum, however, requires capital-intensive facilities and consumes large amounts of electrical power. The continuous production cycle of primary aluminum and the high costs associated with restarting operations after a prolonged interruption or curtailment limit our ability to scale our production to changing economic conditions.</p>

<p>Shipments were up year-over-year from 472,977 tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2013 to 570,600 tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2014, for our United States operations, primarily due to the acquisitions of the Sebree smelter in June 2013 and Mt. Holly in December 2014. In Iceland, shipments increased from 291,621 tonnes for the year ended December 31, 2013 to 296,525 for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to increased production capacity as a result of the ongoing expansion project. Any adverse changes in the conditions that affect shipment volumes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.</p>
