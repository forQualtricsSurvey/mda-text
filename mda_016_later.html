<p>Liquidity and Capital Resources<br>
 <br>
At December 31, 2014 our aggregate cash and cash equivalents totaled $8.6 million.  With the cash balance at December 31, 2014 and the assumptions described below we expect to have sufficient funding to continue our long term business strategy through 2015, ending 2015 with a cash balance of approximately $2.0 million.  Our cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2014 of $8.6 million is $10.5 million lower than the $19.1 million in similar assets held at December 31, 2013 due primarily to negative operating margin (defined as revenues less costs of sales) at the Velardeña Properties of $1.4 million; expenditures of $3.6 million on the restart of mining activities and plant capital and repairs at our Velardeña Properties; $2.5 million in care and maintenance and $1.0 million in drilling costs at our Velardeña Properties; $4.5 million in other exploration expenditures; $1.6 million in maintenance and property holding costs at the El Quevar project;  and $4.6 million in general and administrative expenses; offset in part by net proceeds of $7.4 million received from the sale of shares of our common stock and warrants through an underwritten registered offering and concurrent private placement; $1.0 million in proceeds received from the sale of non-strategic property interests; and a reduction in working capital and other items of $0.3 million primarily related to collections of VAT receivables in Mexico and an increase in accounts payable for expenditures associated with the restart of mining activities at the Velardeña Properties.<br>
 <br>
With the cash balance at December 31, 2014 of $8.6 million and a positive operating margin of $2.5 million from the Velardeña Properties for the full year 2015, assuming metals prices of $17.00 per ounce of silver and $1,250 per ounce of gold, we plan to spend the following amounts totaling approximately $9.1 million during 2015.<br>
 <br>
·                  Approximately $0.3 million for sustaining capital for the Velardeña Properties;<br>
 <br>
·                  Approximately $1.0 million at the El Quevar project to fund ongoing maintenance activities and property holding costs;<br>
 <br>
·                  Approximately $3.0 million on other exploration activities and property holding costs related to the Company’s portfolio of exploration properties located primarily in Mexico; and<br>
 <br>
·                  Approximately $4.5 million on general and administrative costs and $0.3 million in increased working capital primarily related to the build-up of inventories and accounts receivable at the Velardeña Properties.<br>
 <br>
In arriving at our forecast for a cash balance of $2.0 million at the end of 2015 we assumed a price for silver and gold of $17.00 and $1,250 per ounce, respectively.  For the full year 2015, a 10 percent change in the price per ounce of silver would have a $0.9 million impact (positive or negative) on our cash balance at the end of 2015.  A 10 percent change in the price per ounce of gold would have a $0.7 million impact (positive or negative) on our cash balance at the end of 2015.<br>
 <br>
The actual amount that we spend through year end 2015 and the projected year end cash balance may vary significantly from the amounts specified above and will depend on a number of factors, including unexpected costs associated with mining and processing at the Velardeña Properties, and the results of continued project assessment work at our other exploration properties. Despite projections of positive net cash flow by mid-2015 from the Velardeña Properties at metals prices of $17.00 per ounce of silver and $1,250 per ounce of gold, our projected cash balance at the end of 2015 would not be sufficient to provide adequate reserves in the event of decreasing metals prices, interruptions in mining and processing at the Velardeña Properties or to adequately pursue further exploration of our properties in Mexico, requiring us to seek additional funding from equity or debt or from monetization of non-core assets.  There can be no assurance that we would be successful in obtaining sufficient funding from any of these actions or sources in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all.<br>
 <br>
Non-GAAP Financial Measures<br>
 <br>
Cash costs, net of by-product credits, per payable ounce of silver is a non GAAP financial measure that is widely used in the mining industry. Under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), there is no standardized definition of cash cost, net of by-product credits, per payable ounce of silver, and therefore the Company’s forecasted cash costs may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.<br>
 <br>
Forecasted cash costs for the Velardeña Properties were calculated based on the mining plan, and include all forecasted direct and indirect costs associated with the physical activities that would generate concentrate products for sale to customers, including mining to gain access to mineralized materials, mining of mineralized materials and waste, milling, third-party related treatment, refining and transportation costs, on-site administrative costs and royalties. Forecasted cash costs do not include depreciation, depletion, amortization, exploration expenditures, reclamation and remediation costs, sustaining capital, financing costs, income taxes, or corporate general and administrative costs not directly or indirectly related to the Velardeña Properties. By-product credits include forecasted revenues from gold, lead and zinc contained in the products sold to customers. Cash costs, after by-product credits, were divided by the quantity of payable silver forecasted for the period to arrive at cash costs, after by-product credits, per payable ounce of silver. Cost of sales is the most comparable financial measure, calculated in accordance with GAAP, to cash costs. As compared to cash costs, cost of sales includes adjustments for changes in inventory and excludes net revenue from by-products and third-party related treatment, refining and transportation costs, which are reported as part of revenue in accordance with GAAP.<br>
 <br>
We provide cash costs, after by-product credits to provide additional information regarding the performance of the Velardeña Properties, and believe the use of this measure provides investors with useful information about the underlying costs of our mining activities. Cash costs, after by-product credits, is an important statistic that the Company uses to measure the Velardeña Properties’ performance. It also allows us to benchmark the performance of the Velardeña Properties against those operations of our competitors. The statistic is also useful in identifying acquisition and investment opportunities since it provides a common tool for measuring the financial performance of other mines with varying geologic, metallurgical and mining and processing characteristics.</p>
