<p>Table of Contractual Obligations</p>

<p>The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2013:</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>(1) The operating lease obligations are related to our corporate headquarters office in Golden, Colorado, as well as another office lease associated with our Velardeña Properties. The lease for the corporate headquarters office space was renegotiated and extended during the first quarter 2014. The new lease reflects an approximately 46% reduction in space and an approximately 44% reduction in cost beginning March 1, 2014. The new lease expires November 30, 2019. The lease for the Velardeña Properties office expires in 2015.</p>

<p>(2) We make annual maintenance payments of approximately $11,800 to the Mexico federal government to maintain the Velardeña Properties concessions and approximately $34,000 to the Argentine federal government to maintain the El Quevar project concessions. These payments include payments for both owned concessions and concessions held under purchase option agreements.</p>

<p>(3) We cannot currently estimate the life of the Velardeña Properties or El Quevar project. This table assumes that no annual maintenance payments will be made more than five years after December 31, 2013. If we restart the Velardeña Properties beyond five years, we expect that we would make annual maintenance payments of approximately $11,800 per year for the life of the Velardeña mine. If we continue to construct a mine at the El Quevar project, we expect that we would make annual maintenance payments of approximately $34,000 per year for the life of the El Quevar mine.</p>

<p>From time to time we enter into lease or option agreements related to exploration properties that are of interest to us. These agreements typically contain escalating payments required to maintain our exploration rights to the property. Such agreements are not included in the above table because exploration success is historically low and we have the right to terminate the agreements at any time. For example, at the El Quevar project we control the Nevado I concession pursuant to a purchase option agreement with a third party concession owner. Our remaining payment on the Nevado I option agreement totals $550,000 and has been extended to June, 2014.</p>

<p>Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements</p>

<p>We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements.</p>
