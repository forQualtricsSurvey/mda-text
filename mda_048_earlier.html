<p>Operating Expenses:<br>
 <br>
Total operating expenses increased $15.9 million, or 9%, to $186.0 million in 2014 from $170.1 million in 2013, due primarily to an increase in the reduction in value of inventory, discussed further below.<br>
 <br>
Cost of Services<br>
 <br>
Cost of services decreased $0.5 million, or 2%, to $29.7 million in 2014 from $30.2 million in 2013. Cost of services comprises primarily network operating costs, which are generally fixed in nature. As stated above, while we were manufacturing and deploying our second-generation constellation, we purchased service from other satellite providers, which we re-sold to some of our subscribers. We record the expense related to this service in cost of services. As we transition these subscribers to our network, these costs decrease. During 2014, these costs decreased approximately $1.0 million. This decrease was offset partially by increases in multiple expense categories as we expand and update our gateway infrastructure.<br>
 <br>
Cost of Subscriber Equipment Sales<br>
 <br>
Cost of subscriber equipment sales increased $1.2 million, or 9%, to $14.9 million in 2014 from $13.6 million in 2013. The fluctuations in cost of subscriber equipment sales are due primarily to the mix and volume of products sold during the respective years.</p>

<p>Cost of Subscriber Equipment Sales - Reduction in the Value of Inventory<br>
 <br>
Cost of subscriber equipment sales - reduction in the value of inventory was $21.7 million in 2014 compared to $5.8 million in 2013. The 2014 amount consists of the following:</p>

<p>•<br>
During the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded a reduction in the value of inventory of $14.4 million. We recognized these charges after evaluating our Duplex inventory and estimating the timing of new product launches. Our assessment indicated that there was an excess of Duplex equipment included in inventory on hand based on our current sales run-rate.</p>

<p>•<br>
During the second quarter of 2014, we recorded as a reduction in the value of inventory of $7.3 million following cancellation of our contract with Qualcomm related to finished goods and raw materials previously accounted for as advances for inventory on our consolidated balance sheet. This contract was canceled in March 2013, and we entered into an agreement with Qualcomm in July 2014 whereby we paid $0.1 million to Qualcomm for all remaining finished goods and raw materials held at Qualcomm. Our future business plan contemplates using Hughes-based technology in future product development. As a result, much of the raw material held by Qualcomm is not likely to be used in the future production of additional inventory and their value was impaired.<br>
 <br>
Marketing, general and administrative<br>
 <br>
Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased $3.6 million, or 12%, to $33.5 million in 2014 from $29.9 million in 2013. The increase was due primarily to employee-related non-cash costs including an increase in the fair value of stock compensation recognized for new stock options and stock awards granted in the previous 12 months, which represented approximately 42% of the total increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses during 2014.</p>

<p>Reduction in the Value of Long-Lived Assets<br>
  <br>
Reduction in the value of long-lived assets was $0.1 million in 2014 and $0 in 2013. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded a loss of $0.1 million related to an adjustment made to the carrying value of construction in progress. A similar charge did not occur during 2013.<br>
 <br>
Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion<br>
 <br>
Depreciation, amortization, and accretion expense decreased $4.4 million, or 5%, to $86.1 million in 2014 compared to $90.6 million in 2013. This decrease relates primarily to the first-generation satellites launched during 2007 as these satellites reached the end of their estimated depreciable lives during 2014.</p>
