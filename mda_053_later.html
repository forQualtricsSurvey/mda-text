<p>Thermo Loan Agreement<br>
 <br>
In connection with the amendment and restatement of the Facility Agreement, we amended and restated our loan agreement with Thermo (as amended and restated, the “Loan Agreement”). Our obligations to Thermo under the Loan Agreement are subordinated to all of our obligations under the Facility Agreement.</p>

<p>Amounts outstanding under the Loan Agreement accrue interest at 12% per annum, which we capitalize and add to the outstanding principal in lieu of cash payments. We will make payments to Thermo only when permitted by the Facility Agreement. Principal and interest under the Loan Agreement become due and payable six months after the obligations under the Facility Agreement have been paid in full, or earlier if a change in control or any acceleration of the maturity of the loans under the Facility Agreement occurs. As of December 31, 2015, $39.7 million of interest was outstanding under the Thermo Loan Agreement; we include this amount in long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheets.</p>

<p>In connection with the 2015 GARA, Thermo and certain of its affiliates executed and delivered to the agent under the Facility Agreement the Second Thermo Group Undertaking Letter in which they agreed that, during the period commencing on the effective date of the 2015 GARA and ending on the later of March 31, 2018 and, if our 8% Notes Issued in 2013 have been redeemed in full, September 30, 2019, they will make, or cause to be made, available to us cash equity financing in the aggregate amount of $30.0 million. Thermo must provide these funds during this period if we request the funds or an event of default occurs and is continuing under the Facility Agreement, and Terrapin fails to purchase shares of our voting common stock to provide us with cash proceeds requested under the August 2015 Terrapin Agreement. The balance of this commitment will be reduced by any cash equity financing which we receive during the Commitment Period from Thermo or an external equity funding source, including Terrapin, which we use as an Equity Cure Contribution. In August 2015, we made a first draw under the August 2015 Terrapin agreement in the amount of $15.0 million, which reduced Thermo&#x27;s remaining cash equity commitment to $15.0 million as of December 31, 2015.</p>

<p>In connection with the 2015 GARA, the Second Thermo Group Undertaking Letter and the Equity Agreement, we agreed to increase the principal amount under the Thermo Loan Agreement by $6.0 million. All of the transactions between us and Thermo and its affiliates were reviewed and approved on our behalf by a special committee consisting of our independent directors, who were represented by independent counsel.<br>

See Note 3: Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements in our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Second Thermo Group Undertaking Letter, the Equity Agreement, and the New Thermo Loan Agreement.</p>
