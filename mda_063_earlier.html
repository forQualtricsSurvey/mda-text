<p>Derivative Instruments<br>
 <br>
We recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at their respective fair values. We record recognized gains or losses on derivative instruments in the consolidated statements of operations.<br>
 <br>
We estimate the fair values of our derivative financial instruments using various techniques that are considered to be consistent with the objective of measuring fair values. In selecting the appropriate technique, we consider, among other factors, the nature of the instrument, the market risks that embody it and the expected means of settlement. We determine the fair value of our interest rate cap using pricing models developed based on the LIBOR rate and other observable market data. We adjust the value to reflect nonperformance risk of both the counterparty and us. There are various features embedded in our debt instruments that require bifurcation from the debt host. For the conversion options and the contingent put features in the Amended and Restated Thermo Loan and the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013, we use a blend of a Monte Carlo simulation model and market prices to determine fair value. Valuations derived from these models are subject to ongoing internal and external verification and review. Estimating fair values of derivative financial instruments requires the development of significant and subjective estimates that may, and are likely to, change over the duration of the instrument with related changes in internal and external market factors. Our financial position and results of operations may vary materially from quarter-to-quarter based on conditions other than our operating revenues and expenses.</p>

<p>Inventory<br>
 <br>
Inventory consists of purchased products and accessories. We compute cost using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method and state inventory transactions at the lower of cost or market. We measure inventory write-downs as the difference between the cost of inventory and market value, and record them as a cost of subscriber equipment sales - reduction in the value of inventory. At the point of any inventory write-downs to market value, we establish a new, lower cost basis for that inventory, and any subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration of the former cost basis or increase in that newly established cost basis.<br>
 <br>
We review product sales and returns from the previous 12 months and future demand forecasts and write off any excess or obsolete inventory. We also assess inventory for obsolescence by testing finished goods to ensure they have been properly stored and maintained so that they will perform according to specifications. In addition, we assess the market for competing products to determine that the existing inventory will be competitive in the marketplace. We also record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory.</p>

<p>If there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in future demand for our products, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, we could be required to write down our inventory, and accordingly gross margin could be adversely affected.<br>
 <br>
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts<br>
 <br>
We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of some of our customers to make required payments. We review these estimated allowances on a case by case basis, analyzing the customer&#x27;s payment history and information regarding the customer&#x27;s creditworthiness known to us. In addition, we record a reserve based on the size and age of all receivable balances against those balances that do not have specific reserves. If the financial condition of our customers deteriorates, resulting in their inability to make payments, we would record additional allowances.<br>
 <br>
Pension Plan<br>
 <br>
We calculate our pension benefit obligation and expense using actuarial models. Critical assumptions and estimates we use in the actuarial calculations include discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and other participant data, such as demographic factors, mortality, and termination.<br>
 <br>
We determine discount rates annually based on our calculated average of rates of return of long-term corporate bonds. We base discount rates on Prudential’s yield curve index. The discount rate used at the measurement date decreased to 4.03% at December 31, 2014, from 4.80% as of December 31, 2013. A 100 basis point increase in our discount rate would reduce our benefit obligation by $2.2 million.<br>
 <br>
We determine expected long-term rates of return on plan assets based on an evaluation of our plan assets, historical trends and experience, taking into account current and expected market conditions. Plan assets are comprised primarily of equity and debt securities. The rate of return on plan assets assumption was 7.12% in 2014 and 7.12% in 2013. To determine the rates of return, we consider historical experience and expected future performance of plan assets.<br>
 <br>
Stock-Based Compensation<br>
 <br>
To measure compensation expense, we use valuation models which require estimates such as, forfeitures, vesting terms, volatility, and risk free interest rates. Additionally we recognize stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service periods of the awards on a straight-line basis, which is generally commensurate with the vesting term.<br>
 <br>
Long-Lived Assets<br>
 <br>
We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any asset may not be recoverable. In the event of impairment, we write the asset down to its fair market value.<br>
   <br>
Litigation, Commitments and Contingencies<br>
 <br>
We are subject to various claims and lawsuits that arise in the ordinary course of business. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based on professional knowledge and experience of our management and legal counsel. The ultimate resolution of any such exposure may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known.</p>
