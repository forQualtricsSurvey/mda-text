<p>Financing Activities</p>

<p>Cash used for financing activities was $146.8 million, $151.1 million and $152.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of dividends declared and paid during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016. Financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 included the redemption of Cinemark USA, Inc.’s previously outstanding $200.0 million 7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes with proceeds from the issuance of a $225.0 million add-on to Cinemark USA, Inc.’s existing 4.875% Senior Notes as well as associated debt issue costs. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements.</p>

<p>We, at the discretion of the board of directors and subject to applicable law, anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends on our common stock. The amount, if any, of the dividends to be paid in the future will depend upon our then available cash, anticipated cash needs, overall financial condition, loan agreement restrictions as discussed below, future prospects for earnings and cash flows, as well as other relevant factors.<br>
We may from time to time, subject to compliance with our debt instruments, purchase our debt securities on the open market depending upon the availability and prices of such securities.</p>

The contractual obligations table excludes the long-term portion of our liability for uncertain tax positions of $8.1 million because we cannot make a reliable estimate of the timing of the related cash payments.</p>
