<p>Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements</p>

<p>Other than the operating leases and purchase and other commitments disclosed in the tables above, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.</p>

<p>Senior Secured Credit Facility</p>

<p>Cinemark USA, Inc. has a senior secured credit facility that includes a seven year $700.0 million term loan and a five year $100.0 million revolving credit line (the “Credit Agreement”).<br>
On May 8, 2015, Cinemark USA, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, amended its Credit Agreement to extend the maturity of the $700.0 million term loan from December 2019 to May 2022. Subsequent to the amendment, quarterly principal payments in the amount of $1.8 million were due on the term loan through March 31, 2022, with the remaining principal of $635.3 million due on May 8, 2022. The Company incurred debt issue costs of approximately $6.9 million in connection with the amendment, which are reflected as a reduction of long term debt on the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the Company incurred approximately $0.9 million in legal and other fees that are reflected as loss on debt amendments and refinancing on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2015.</p>

<p>On May 16, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. made a pre-payment of $13.5 million on its term loan using the net proceeds received from the sale of shares of RealD (see Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements). In accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, the pre-payment was applied first to the next four principal installments, and second, to the remaining installments pro-rata based on the remaining outstanding principal amount of such installments. Therefore, subsequent to the prepayment, quarterly payments in the amount of $1.4 million are due on the term loan beginning June 30, 2017 through March 31, 2022, with the remaining principal of $635.3 million due on May 8, 2022. The Company did not incur any fees as a result of the pre-payment.</p>

<p>On June 13, 2016 and December 15, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. amended its Credit Agreement to reduce the rate at which the term loan bears interest by 0.25% and then an additional 0.50%, respectively. The Company incurred debt issue costs of approximately $3.5 million in connection with these amendments, which are reflected as a reduction of long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016. In addition, the Company incurred approximately $0.4 million in legal and other fees that are reflected as loss on debt amendments and refinancing on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016.</p>

<p>Interest on the term loan accrues at Cinemark USA, Inc.’s option at: (A) the base rate equal to the greater of (1) the US “Prime Rate” as quoted in The Wall Street Journal or if no such rate is quoted therein, in a Federal Reserve Board statistical release, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and (3) a one-month Eurodollar-based rate plus 1.0%, plus, in each case, a margin of 1.25% per annum, or (B) a Eurodollar-based rate for a period of 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 months plus a margin of 2.25% per annum. Interest on the revolving credit line accrues, at our option, at: (A) a base rate equal to the greater of (1) the US “Prime Rate” as quoted in The Wall Street Journal or if no such rate is quoted therein, in a Federal Reserve Board statistical release, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and (3) a one-month Eurodollar-based rate plus 1.0%, plus, in each case, a margin that ranges from 1.00% to 1.75% per annum, or (B) a Eurodollar-based rate for a period of 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 months plus a margin that ranges from 2.00% to 2.75% per annum. The margin of the revolving credit line is determined by the consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio as defined in the Credit Agreement.</p>

<p>Cinemark USA, Inc.’s obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Cinemark Holdings, Inc. and certain of Cinemark USA, Inc.’s domestic subsidiaries and are secured by mortgages on certain fee and leasehold properties and security interests in substantially all of Cinemark USA, Inc.’s and the guarantors’ personal property, including, without limitation, pledges of all of Cinemark USA, Inc.’s capital stock, all of the capital stock of certain of Cinemark USA, Inc.’s domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the voting stock of certain of its foreign subsidiaries.</p>

<p>The Credit Agreement contains usual and customary negative covenants for agreements of this type, including, but not limited to, restrictions on Cinemark USA, Inc.’s ability, and in certain instances, its subsidiaries’ and our ability, to consolidate or merge or liquidate, wind up or dissolve; substantially change the nature of its business; sell, transfer or dispose of assets; create or incur indebtedness; create liens; pay dividends or repurchase stock; and make capital expenditures and investments. If Cinemark USA, Inc. has borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit line, it is required to satisfy a consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio covenant as defined in the Credit Agreement.</p>

<p>The dividend restriction contained in the Credit Agreement prevents the Company and any of its subsidiaries from paying a dividend or otherwise distributing cash to its stockholders unless (1) the Company is not in default, and the distribution would not cause Cinemark USA, Inc. to be in default, under the Credit Agreement; and (2) the aggregate amount of certain dividends, distributions, investments, redemptions and capital expenditures made since December 18, 2012, including dividends declared by the board of directors, is less than the sum of (a) the aggregate amount of cash and cash equivalents received by Cinemark Holdings, Inc. or Cinemark USA, Inc. as common equity since December 18, 2012, (b) Cinemark USA, Inc.’s consolidated EBITDA minus 1.75 times its consolidated interest expense, each as defined in the Credit Agreement, and (c) certain other defined amounts. As of December 31, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. could have distributed up to approximately $2,390.4 million to its parent company and sole stockholder, Cinemark Holdings, Inc., under the terms of the Credit Agreement, subject to its available cash and other borrowing restrictions outlined in the agreement.</p>

<p>At December 31, 2016, there was $663.8 million outstanding under the term loan and no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit line. Cinemark USA, Inc. had $100.0 million in available borrowing capacity on the revolving credit line. Cinemark USA, Inc. had no borrowings under the revolving credit line during the years ended December 31, 2015 or 2016. The average interest rate on outstanding term loan borrowings under the Credit Agreement at December 31, 2016 was approximately 3.0% per annum.</p>
