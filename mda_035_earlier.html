<p>Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015</p>

<p>Revenues. Total revenues increased $66.2 million to $2,918.8 million for 2016 from $2,852.6 million for 2015, representing a 2.3% increase. The table below, presented by reportable operating segment, summarizes our year-over-year revenue performance and certain key performance indicators that impact our revenues.</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>(1) 	<br>
Revenue and attendance amounts in millions. Average ticket price is calculated as admissions revenues divided by attendance. Concession revenues per patron is calculated as concession revenues divided by attendance.</p>

<p>(2) 	<br>
U.S. operating segment revenues include eliminations of intercompany transactions with the international operating segment. See Note 18 of our consolidated financial statements.</p>

<p>(3) 	<br>
Constant currency revenue amounts, which are non-GAAP measurements, were calculated using the average exchange rates for the corresponding months for 2015. We translate the results of our international operating segment from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates from one period to the next can result in meaningful variations in reported results. We are providing constant currency amounts for our international operating segment to present a period-to-period comparison of business performance without the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.</p>

<p>•	 	<br>
U.S. Admissions revenues increased $41.0 million due to a 1.7% increase in attendance and a 1.3% increase in average ticket price. The increase in concession revenues of $54.9 million was attributable to the 1.7% increase in attendance and a 6.1% increase in concession revenues per patron. The increase in attendance was due to the solid slate of films released during 2016 and new theatres. The increase in average ticket price was primarily due to price increases. The increase in concession revenues per patron was primarily due to incremental sales incidence and price increases.</p>

<p>•	 	<br>
International. Admissions revenues decreased $17.3 million as reported, primarily due to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate, partially offset by a 4.1% increase in attendance. Admissions revenues increased $55.9 million in constant currency, primarily due to the 4.1% increase in attendance and an 8.7% increase in constant currency average ticket price. Concession revenues decreased $1.8 million as reported, primarily due to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate, partially offset by the 4.1% increase in attendance. Concession revenues increased $35.9 million in constant currency, primarily due to the 4.1%  	<br>
increase in attendance and an 11.5% increase in constant currency concession revenues per patron. The increase in attendance was due to new theatres and the success of the films released during 2016. The increase in constant currency average ticket price and concession revenues per patron was primarily driven by price increases, which was primarily due to local inflation.</p>

<p>Cost of Operations. The table below summarizes certain of our theatre operating costs by reportable operating segment (in millions) for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016.</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>(1) 	<br>
We made certain reclassifications from film rentals and advertising to utilities and other for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to the maintenance and monitoring of projection and sound equipment, which results in a more clear presentation of film rentals and advertising costs. Such expenses, which totaled $23.9 million and $7.1 million for the U.S. operating segment and the international operating segment, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015 are now presented as utilities and other.</p>

<p>(2) 	<br>
Constant currency expense amounts, which are non-GAAP measurements, were calculated using the average exchange rates for the corresponding months for 2015. We translate the results of our international operating segment from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates from one period to the next can result in meaningful variations in reported results. We are providing constant currency amounts for our international operating segment to present a period-to-period comparison of business performance without the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.</p>

<p>•	 	<br>
U.S. Film rentals and advertising costs were $768.9 million, or 55.8% of admissions revenues, for 2016 compared to $744.3 million, or 55.6% of admissions revenues, for 2015. The increase in the film rentals and advertising rate was primarily due to the higher concentration of blockbuster films during the 2016 period. Concession supplies expense was $107.3 million, or 14.0% of concession revenues, for 2016 compared to $95.4 million, or 13.4% of concession revenues, for 2015. The increase in the concession supplies rate was primarily due to the impact of our expanded concession offerings.</p>

<p>Salaries and wages increased to $248.2 million for 2016 from $226.9 million for 2015 primarily due to new theatres and increases in minimum wages. Facility lease expense increased to $240.7 million for 2016 from $239.4 million for 2015 primarily due to increased percentage rent expense partially offset by decreased common area maintenance expenses. Utilities and other costs decreased to $250.9 million for 2016 from $251.9 million for 2015 primarily due to a decrease in projection and sound equipment maintenance and monitoring expenses, partially offset by increased security expense.<br>
 <br>
•	 	<br>
International. Film rentals and advertising costs were $193.8 million ($228.5 million in constant currency), or 47.2% of admissions revenues, for 2016 compared to $201.3 million, or 47.1 % of admissions revenues, for 2015. Concession supplies expense was $47.2 million ($54.9 million in constant currency), or 20.9% of concession revenues, for 2016 compared to $48.9 million, or 21.5% of concession revenues, for 2015. The decrease in the concession supplies rate was primarily due to price increases.</p>

<p>Salaries and wages increased to $77.6 million ($93.9 million in constant currency) for 2016 compared to $74.2 million for 2015. The as reported increase was due to incremental staffing to support the 4.1% increase in attendance, increased wage rates and new theatres, partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate. Facility lease expense increased to $80.6 million ($91.8 million in constant currency) for 2016 compared to $80.3 million for the 2015 period. The as reported increase was due to increased percentage rent expense as a result of increased constant currency revenues and new theatres, partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate. Utilities and other costs increased to $105.0 million ($123.4 million in constant currency) for 2016 compared to $104.0 million for 2015. The as reported increase was primarily due to increased utilities costs, increased projection and sound equipment and monitoring expenses, increased repairs and maintenance expenses and increased janitorial services, partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate.</p>

<p>General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased to $143.4 million for 2016 from $156.7 million for 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate, partially offset by increased salaries and incentive compensation expense.</p>

<p>Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense was $209.1 million for 2016 compared to $189.2 million for 2015. The increase was primarily due to depreciation expense related to new theatres as well as remodels and other improvements of existing theatres.</p>

<p>Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. We recorded asset impairment charges on assets held and used of $2.8 million for 2016 compared to $8.8 million for 2015. Impairment charges for 2016 consisted of theatre properties in the U.S., Colombia and Ecuador, impacting eight of our twenty-seven reporting units. Impairment charges for 2015 consisted of theatre properties in the U.S., Colombia and Ecuador, impacting fourteen of our twenty-seven reporting units. The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during each of the periods presented were specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre. See Notes 1 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements.</p>

<p>Loss on Sale of Assets and Other. We recorded a loss on sale of assets and other of $20.4 million during 2016 compared to $8.1 million during 2015. The loss recorded during the 2016 period was primarily due to the retirement of assets due to theatre remodels and closures, partially offset by a gain on the sale of our investment in RealD stock (see Note 6) and a gain on the sale of a land parcel. The loss recorded during 2015 included lease termination costs, contract termination costs and the retirement of assets due to theatre remodels and closures, partially offset by gains related to lease amendments that resulted in a reduction of certain capital lease liabilities, the sale of an investment in a Taiwan joint venture, and the sale of a land parcel in the U.S.</p>

<p>Interest Expense. Interest costs incurred, including amortization of debt issue costs, were $108.3 million for 2016 compared to $112.7 million for 2015. The decrease was due to the redemption of our previously outstanding $200.0 million 7.375% senior subordinated notes (the “7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes”) funded by a $225.0 million add-on to our 4.875% senior notes (the “4.875% Senior Notes), which occurred on March 21, 2016, as well as the amendments in June and December of 2016 to our senior secured credit facility, each of which reduced the rate at which our $700.0 million term loan accrues interest. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our long-term debt.</p>

<p>Foreign Currency Exchange Gain (Loss). We recorded a foreign currency exchange gain of $6.5 million during 2016 compared to a foreign currency exchange loss of $16.8 million during 2015 primarily related to intercompany transactions and changes in exchange rates from the original transaction date until cash settlement. See Notes 1 and 12 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of foreign currency translation.</p>

<p>Loss on Debt Amendments and Refinancing. We recorded a loss of $13.4 million during 2016 primarily related to the early redemption of our 7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes and the amendments, in June and December of 2016, to our senior secured credit facility, each of which reduced the rate at which our $700.0 million term loan accrues interest. We recorded a loss of $0.9 million in 2015 related to an amendment to our senior secured credit facility. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of our long-term debt.</p>

<p>Distributions from NCM. We recorded distributions received from NCM of $14.7 million during 2016 and $18.1 million during 2015, which were in excess of the carrying value of our Tranche 1 Investment. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.</p>

<p>Equity in Income of Affiliates. We recorded equity in income of affiliates of $32.0 million during 2016 and $28.1 million during 2015. See Notes 5 and 6 to our consolidated financial statements for information about our equity investments.</p>

<p>Income Taxes. Income tax expense of $103.8 million was recorded for 2016 compared to $128.9 million recorded for 2015. The effective tax rate for 2016 was 28.8%, which included the impact of the implementation of a foreign holding and financing structure that will allow us to use foreign tax credits that had previously carried a full valuation allowance. The effective tax rate for 2015 was 37.1%. See Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.</p>
