<p>Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets</p>

<p>We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be fully recoverable.  We evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and we have allocated goodwill to the reporting unit based on an estimate of its relative fair value. Management considers the reporting unit to be each of its nineteen regions in the U.S. and nine countries internationally with Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala considered one reporting unit (the Company does not have goodwill recorded for all of its international locations). We adopted ASU 2017-04 Intangibles – Goodwill and other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment effective for our annual goodwill impairment evaluation performed during 2017. We performed a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis for all reporting units during 2017, which required us to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill would be written down such that the carrying value would equal estimated fair value. Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value. Management’s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples. Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was eight times for the evaluations performed during 2017.  As of December 31, 2017, the estimated fair value of our goodwill for each reporting unit exceeded their carrying values by more than 10%.</p>

<p>Tradename intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. During 2017, we performed a quantitative tradename impairment assessment for each tradename asset, which included comparing their carrying values to an estimated fair value. We estimated the fair value of our tradenames by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of our tradename to forecasted future revenues, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the tradename intangible asset is written down to its estimated fair value. Significant judgment is involved in estimating market royalty rates and long-term revenue forecasts. Management’s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected revenue performance and industry trends. As of December 31, 2017, the estimated fair value of the Company’s tradename intangible assets exceeded their carrying values by more than 10%.</p>
