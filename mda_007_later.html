<p>Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2012</p>

<p>Net sales: Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased $182.2 million to $1,454.3 million. Higher shipment volumes had a $263.2 million positive impact on net sales. Direct shipments from our four operating smelters increased 108,376 tonnes in 2013 compared to 2012, due to the acquisition of the Sebree smelter on June 1, 2013. Toll shipments increased 9,693 tonnes relative to the same period last year. Lower price realizations for primary aluminum in the year ended December 31, 2013, negatively impacted our net sales by $81.0 million. The monthly average LME cash price for 2013 was down approximately 9% from the monthly average LME cash price in 2012.</p>

<p>Gross profit: During 2013, lower price realizations, net of LME based alumina and power cost decreases, reduced gross profit by $52.0 million, with volume and mix decreasing gross profit by $5.3 million. Offsetting the gross profit reduction of $57.3 million described above were $40.5 million in net cost decreases comprised of: reduced costs for power and natural gas at our U.S. smelters, $12.7 million; reduced costs for maintenance, supplies and materials, $34.9 million; offset by other cost increases, $3.0 million; and higher depreciation charges, $4.1 million.</p>

<p>As part of the accounting for the purchase of the Sebree facility, we recorded a $36.6 million liability for the power contract we assumed based on the difference between the forecasted contract rate and market power rates through the contract termination date in January 2014. This liability will be fully amortized over the period from June 1, 2013 through January 31, 2014 resulting in a credit to our cost of goods sold. During 2013, the credit was $31.0 million reflecting seven months amortization under Century&#x27;s ownership.</p>

<p>Due to the nature of our business, our inventory values are subject to fluctuations in market value and these fluctuations can have a significant impact on cost of goods sold and gross profit in any period. On average our inventory turns eight times within a year and reductions in value below cost basis at the end of a period are the new basis for inventory as it turns in subsequent periods.</p>

<p>As of December 31, 2013, the market value of our inventory was below its cost basis, resulting in the recording of a LCM valuation adjustment and a charge to cost of goods sold of $1.2 million for 2013. During 2012, inventory with a $19.8 million lower basis due to a LCM valuation adjustment at December 31, 2011, was consumed into cost of goods sold at the lower basis. The net impact of the December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2011 market valuation adjustments on the 2013 and 2012 comparative results is a negative gross profit change of $21.0 million.</p>

<p>Other operating expense – net:  Other operating expense is primarily related to costs associated with Ravenswood. In 2012, we accrued for a legal liability that was ultimately settled in 2013 for an amount lower than the accrual. This resulted in a year over year improvement of $6.0 million. A significant portion of the remaining improvement is due to lower expenses for employee benefits.</p>

<p>Selling, general and administrative expenses: During 2013, relocation and severance expenses related to moving our headquarters to Chicago increased selling, general and administrative expenses by $5.8 million; litigation matters, accruals for our performance-based compensation program and other general expenses increased expenses by approximately $7.6 million. In addition, we recorded a charge of $8.4 million in 2013 related to the separation of our former chief executive officer. We also incurred approximately $2.5 million in additional selling, general and administrative expenses associated with the newly acquired Sebree facility. In addition, we experienced a $7.8 million increase in general and administrative expenses in 2013 related to the integration of the Century Vlissingen carbon anode facility into our business. With the restart of operations, Vlissingen costs will be recorded in cost of goods sold beginning in 2014.</p>

<p>Net gain (loss) on forward and derivative contracts:  The net gain on forward and derivative contracts in 2013 was primarily the result of an increase in the fair value of an embedded derivative asset in the E.ON contingent liability. This change in fair value resulted in unrealized gains of $16.8 million in 2013. The net loss on forward and derivative contracts in 2012 related primarily to marking-to-market, and recording settlements, of option contracts that were put in place to provide partial downside price protection for our domestic facilities. As of June 30, 2012, all of these option contracts were settled.</p>

<p>Gain on bargain purchase: On June 1, 2013, we acquired the Sebree smelter. Based on the purchase price allocation, we recorded a gain on bargain purchase of $5.3 million. The gain on bargain purchase reflects the LME market and the risk associated with the power agreement for the facility at June 1, 2013. See Note 2 Business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information.</p>

<p>Loss on early extinguishment of debt: As a result of the tender offer and redemption of the 8% Notes, we recorded charges of $3.3 million for loss on early extinguishment of debt. The loss on early extinguishment of debt consisted of the write-off of deferred financing costs and the debt discount associated with the 8.0% Notes, as well as the tender premium paid as part of the 8.0% Notes Tender Offer. See Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information.</p>

<p>Other income – net: During 2012, Grundartangi received a $7.9 million settlement payment for the costs to repair a transformer damaged in transit, a related business interruption claim, interest and other fees associated with the claim. A significant portion of the remainder of other income – net relates to exchange rate gains and losses, the majority of which relate to items denominated in ISK.</p>

<p>Income tax expense: Our 2013 and 2012 income tax expense was primarily driven by our earnings in Iceland.</p>
