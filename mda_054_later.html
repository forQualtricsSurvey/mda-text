<p>8.00% Convertible Senior Notes Issued in 2013<br>
 <br>
Our 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 initially were convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $0.80 per share of common stock, or 1,250 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013, subject to adjustment. Due to common stock issuances by us since May 20, 2013 at prices below the then effective conversion rate, the base conversion rate was $0.73 per share of common stock as of December 31, 2015.</p>

<p>Interest on the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. We pay interest in cash at a rate of 5.75% per annum and by issuing additional 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 at a rate of 2.25% per annum.</p>

<p>A holder of 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 has the right, at the holder’s option, to require us to purchase some or all of the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 on each of April 1, 2018 and April 1, 2023 at a price equal to the principal amount of the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 to be purchased plus accrued and unpaid interest.</p>

<p>The indenture governing the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 provides for customary events of default. If there is an event of default, the Trustee may, at the direction of the holders of 25% or more in aggregate principal amount of the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013, accelerate the maturity of the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013. As of December 31, 2015, we were not in default under the indenture governing the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013.</p>
