<p>Thermo Loan Agreement<br>
 <br>
We have an Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (the &quot;Loan Agreement&quot;) with Thermo whereby Thermo agreed to lend us $25.0 million for the purpose of funding the debt service reserve account required under the Facility Agreement. In 2011, this loan was increased to $37.5 million. This loan is subordinated to, and the debt service reserve account is pledged to secure, all of our obligations under the Facility Agreement. Amounts deposited in the debt service reserve account are restricted to payments due under the Facility Agreement, unless otherwise authorized by the lenders.<br>
 <br>
The loan accrues interest at 12% per annum, which is capitalized and added to the outstanding principal in lieu of cash payments. We will make payments to Thermo only when permitted under the Facility Agreement. The loan becomes due and payable six months after the obligations under the Facility Agreement have been paid in full, if a change in control occurs or if any acceleration of the maturity of the loans under the Facility Agreement occurs. As of December 31, 2014, $30.7 million of interest was outstanding; this amount is included in long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet.<br>
 <br>
In connection with the amendment and restatement of our Facility Agreement, we also amended and restated the Loan Agreement in July 2013. The 2013 amendment and restatement of the Loan Agreement made the following changes:<br>
 <br>
•<br>
Provided that the indebtedness under the Loan Agreement would be represented by a promissory note.<br>
•<br>
Provided that if a Fundamental Change (as defined in the New Indenture - see 8.00% Convertible Senior Notes Issued in 2013 below) occurs prior to the repayment of the indebtedness, we would pay Thermo an amount equal to the Fundamental Make-Whole Amount (as defined in the New Indenture).<br>
•<br>
Provided that the indebtedness under the Loan Agreement is convertible into our common stock on substantially the same terms as the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013, excluding the conversion features on special conversion dates as defined in the Indenture.</p>

<p>The terms of the amendment and restatement were approved by a special committee of our board of directors consisting solely of our unaffiliated directors. The committee was represented by independent legal counsel.<br>
 <br>
Based on our evaluation, the 2013 amendment and restatement of the Loan Agreement was deemed to be an extinguishment of debt. As a result, we recorded a non-cash loss on extinguishment of debt of $66.1 million in our consolidated statement of operations during the third quarter of 2013. This non-cash loss represents the difference between the fair value of the Loan Agreement, as amended and restated, and its carrying value just prior to amendment and restatement. See Note 5: Fair Value Measurements in our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the fair value of this instrument.</p>
