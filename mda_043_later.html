<p>Covenant Compliance</p>

<p>As of December 31, 2017, we believe we were in full compliance with all agreements, including all related covenants, governing our outstanding debt.</p>

<p>Ratings</p>

<p>We are rated by nationally recognized rating agencies. The rating scales and methodologies used to derive individual ratings may vary from agency to agency. Credit ratings are issued by credit rating agencies based on evaluations of our ability to pay back our outstanding debt and the likelihood that we would default on that debt prior to its maturity.  The credit ratings issued by the credit rating agencies represent the credit rating agency&#x27;s evaluation of both qualitative and quantitative information for our company. The credit ratings that are issued are based on the credit rating agency’s judgment and experience in determining what information should be considered in giving a rating to a particular company. Ratings are always subject to change and there can be no assurance that our current ratings will continue for any given period of time. A downgrade of our debt ratings, depending on the extent, could increase the cost to borrow funds. Below are our current credit ratings.</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>With respect to the ratings issued by Moody’s as noted above, Moody’s defines these ratings as follows:<br>
 <br>
•<br>
‘Ba1’ – Obligations rated Ba are judged to be speculative and are subject to substantial credit risk. The Prime-1 rating indicates the issuer has a superior ability to repay short-term debt obligations.<br>
 <br>
•<br>
‘B2’ – Obligations rated B are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk. The Prime-2 portion of the rating indicates issuer has a strong ability to repay short-term debt obligations.<br>
With respect to the ratings issued by Standard and Poor’s as noted above, Standard and Poor’s defines these ratings as follows:<br>
 <br>
•<br>
BBB - An obligation rated &#x27;BBB&#x27; exhibits adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.<br>
 <br>
•<br>
BB - An obligation rated &#x27;BB&#x27; is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, which could lead to the obligor&#x27;s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.</p>
