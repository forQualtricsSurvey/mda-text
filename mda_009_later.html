<p>We intend to finance our future recurring capital expenditures from available cash, cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. For major investment projects, such as the Helguvik project, we would likely seek financing from various capital and loan markets, and may potentially pursue the formation of strategic alliances. We may be unable, however, to issue additional debt or equity securities, or enter into other financing arrangements on attractive terms, or at all, due to a number of factors including a lack of demand, unfavorable pricing, poor economic conditions, unfavorable interest rates, or our financial condition or credit rating at the time. Future uncertainty in the U.S. and international markets and economies may adversely affect our liquidity, our ability to access the debt or capital markets and our financial condition.</p>

<p>Capital expenditures for 2014 were $55.1 million, compared to $68.1 million for 2013. Capital expenditures for 2014 include approximately $12.8 million for the Grundartangi expansion project and approximately $13.2 million was related to Vlissingen. The remaining amounts are related to upgrading production equipment, improving facilities and complying with environmental requirements. We believe total capital spending in 2015 will be approximately $80 to $90 million, primarily related to our ongoing expansion project at Grundartangi, our restart of the second furnace at Vlissingen and other investment projects at our North American facilities.</p>

<p>In connection with the restart and expansion of production capacity at Vlissingen, we made approximately $13.2 million in aggregate capital expenditures in 2014, compared to $18.2 million in 2013. In late 2014, we began a project to restart the second baking furnace at Vlissingen, which will increase total annual carbon anode production capacity to 150,000 tonnes. The project is expected to be completed by the end of 2015 at an estimated cost of $15 million.</p>

<p>In fourth quarter of 2014, we also began a capital project to improve the efficiency of Hawesville&#x27;s carbon anode rodding operations. The project is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 at an estimated cost of $16 million. We incurred $0.7 million in capital expenditures towards this project for the year ended December 31, 2014.</p>

<p>We have made aggregate capital expenditures through December 31, 2014 related to the construction and development of the Helguvik project of approximately $148 million and we continue to make capital expenditures for this project. We also have substantial future contractual commitments for the Helguvik project. Capital expenditures for 2014 for the Helguvik project were approximately $0.3 million. If we were to cancel the Helguvik project, we estimate that our exposure to contract cancellation costs and other costs would be approximately $20 million, of which we currently have accrued liabilities of approximately $12.1 million. We are continuing to negotiate with the power suppliers to the project to, among other things, remove all the remaining conditions to their obligations to supply contracted power. The timing of the power availability together with other factors will determine the timing of resumption of major construction activity at Helguvik. We expect that capital expenditures for this project will be less than $0.5 million per year until the restart of major construction activities at Helguvik. We cannot, at this time, predict when the restart of major construction activity will occur. See Item 1A, &quot;Risk Factors — Construction at our Helguvik smelter site has been significantly curtailed.  Substantial delay in the completion of this project may increase its cost, subject us to losses and impose other risks to completion that are not foreseeable at this time&quot; included herein.</p>
