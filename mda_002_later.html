<p>Electrical power represents our single largest operating cost. As a result, the availability of reliable electrical power at competitive prices is critical to the profitability and viability of our operations. Historically, our domestic operations relied on long-term fixed price power supply agreements or power supply agreements based on tariff and/or cost-based pricing. Over the past two years, we have migrated our operations in Kentucky to market-based electrical power supply agreements. Currently, Hawesville and Sebree have market-based power agreements whereby EDF and Kenergy purchase power on the open market and pass it through to our operations at MISO pricing plus transmission and other costs incurred by them.</p>

<p>Power is supplied to Mt. Holly pursuant to a power agreement with Santee Cooper with an effective term through December 2015. Mt. Holly&#x27;s current power agreement allows Mt. Holly to receive all or a portion of its supplemental power requirements from an off-system natural gas-fired power generation facility (the &quot;off-system facility&quot;). The energy charge for supplemental power from the off-system facility is based on the cost of natural gas rather than Santee Cooper&#x27;s system average fuel costs, which are primarily coal-based. On June 30, 2014, Mt. Holly gave notice to Santee Cooper under the Santee Cooper Agreement to reduce the contract demand to zero effective December 31, 2015. We are continuing discussions with Santee Cooper and other parties regarding power arrangements for Mt. Holly following December 31, 2015. Unlike the utility serving our Kentucky operations, Santee Cooper is not a participant in an organized power market and any arrangements for power supply other than from Santee Cooper’s generation portfolio must be bilateral with an identified seller and transmission right.</p>

<p>We continue to engage in discussions with APCo and other stakeholders in West Virginia. The possibility of a restart of the curtailed operations at Ravenswood becomes more likely if we are able to negotiate a competitively priced power agreement.</p>
