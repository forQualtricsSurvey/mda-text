<p>Derivative Instruments<br>
 <br>
We recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at their respective fair values. We record recognized gains or losses on derivative instruments in the consolidated statements of operations.<br>
 <br>
We estimate the fair values of our derivative financial instruments using various techniques that are considered to be consistent with the objective of measuring fair values. In selecting the appropriate technique, we consider, among other factors, the nature of the instrument, the market risks that embody it and the expected means of settlement. We determine the fair value of our interest rate cap using pricing models developed based on the LIBOR rate and other observable market data. We adjust the value to reflect nonperformance risk of both the counterparty and us. There are various features embedded in our debt instruments that require bifurcation from the debt host. For the conversion options and the contingent put features in the Amended and Restated Thermo Loan and the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013, we use a blend of a Monte Carlo simulation model and market prices to determine fair value. Valuations derived from these models are subject to ongoing internal and external verification and review. Estimating fair values of derivative financial instruments requires the development of significant and subjective estimates that may, and are likely to, change over the duration of the instrument with related changes in internal and external market factors. Our financial position and results of operations may vary materially from quarter-to-quarter based on conditions other than our operating revenues and expenses.</p>
