Our Company<br>
 <br>
We were incorporated in Delaware under the Delaware General Corporation Law in March 2009, and are the successor to Apex Silver for purposes of reporting under the Exchange Act. During the year ended December 31, 2013, our only sources of income were revenues from the sale of precipitates and concentrates from our Velardeña Properties, royalty and interest income, and sales of non-core exploration properties. We incurred net operating losses for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.</p>
