<p>Liquidity and Capital Resources</p>

<p>The Company used $34,095 of cash in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to using $6,214 in the prior year.</p>

<p>Net income of $4,066, non-cash depreciation, amortization of intangibles, other assets and discounted future liabilities generated $22,467 as compared to $19,617 in the prior year. Additionally, stock based compensation of $3,853, loss from equity method investment of $983, offset by a gain on dilution of $954, and change in value of deferred income taxes of $2,619, provided a net cash inflow of $33,034, as compared to $60,437 for the same period of 2013.</p>

<p>As of December 31, 2014, our working capital has increased to $205,804, as compared to $139,007 as of December 31, 2013. This increase was mainly driven by increased inventory levels and to a lesser extent, accounts receivable. Furthermore, our accounts payable decreased and we have small decreases in programs and deferred revenues.</p>

<p>At December 31, 2014, our receivables were $88,423 as compared to $74,952 at the end of the prior year. The change reflects a higher proportion of international sales with longer payment terms, longer credit terms on some corn products sold domestically in the third quarter of 2014 and the specific mix of sales during the final quarter of the year. There have been no material changes in the credit terms offered to customers.</p>

<p>Inventories ended the year at $165,631, as compared to $139,830 at December 31, 2013. The increase was caused by elevated levels of inventory in the channel at the start of the year. During 2014, to a degree, our customers have made decisions to drive down their in-house inventories before buying from the Company. At the end of 2014, we believe that in-channel inventories are lower than at the end of the prior year and should allow more normal levels of buying to occur in 2015. It should also be noted that the Company purchases and holds raw material, intermediate or finished goods inventory from time to time based on a single annual purchase from a single source or supplier, potentially resulting in peaks in the carrying value of inventory. Furthermore, in order to achieve efficient manufacturing runs, the Company may manufacture a particular product only one time a year and then carry high levels of that inventory for a period.</p>

<p>Deferred revenues ended at $898 at December 31, 2014 as compared to $3,788 at December 31, 2013. These amounts are primarily related to prepayment received from some of our customers. The Company continues to build its patented delivery systems in support of field stewardship and, as a result, prepaid expenses and other assets increased by $4,743. Furthermore, as we continue to hold back manufacturing activity, accounts payable decreased by $19,951. Offsetting these changes, the Company reduced its income tax receivable by $4,424 following the filing of our 2013 federal and state tax returns and the receipt of tax overpayments. These effects were offset by the election to carry back 2014 taxable attributes to 2012.</p>

<p>Our program accruals have decreased by $1,084 to end at $52,546 at December 31, 2014, as compared to an increase of $21,295 to end at $53,630 at December 31, 2013, reflecting primarily the mix of business that has driven the financial performance for 2014. The Company accrues programs in line with the growing season upon which specific products are targeted. Typically crop products have a growing season that ends on September 30 of each year. During the 2014 year, the Company made accruals for programs in the amount of $59,671 and made payments in the amount of $60,755. During the prior year, the Company made accruals in the amount of $92,960 and made payments in the amount of $71,665. Furthermore, accrued expenses reduced by $3,018 and other liabilities reduced by $595.</p>

<p>The Company used $7,680 in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $18,947 in the same period of 2013. In 2014, the Company spent $7,180 on fixed assets primarily focused on continuing to invest in manufacturing infrastructure, and $500 on investments.</p>

<p>Our financing activities provided net cash of $41,156 in 2014 as compared to using $7,123 in 2013. The main driver for the change is increased borrowings under our senior secured credit facility. The cash provided from the borrowings was used to pay dividends of $5,672, and the payment of other notes payable and long-term liabilities primarily associated with liabilities under deferred purchase agreements on product acquisitions in the amount of $1,756. The Company received $1,966 from the exercise of stock options and the sales of common stock under its ESPP plan (including associated tax benefits), as compared to $2,050 for the same period of last year. The Company’s net borrowings under its senior secured credit facility increased by $47,850 to end at $99,400 as of December 31, 2014, as compared to $51,550 at the end of prior year.</p>

<p>The Company has various loans in place that together constitute the short-term and long-term loan balances shown in the balance sheet as at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. These are summarized in the following table:</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>On June 17, 2013, AMVAC Chemical Corporation (“AMVAC”), the Company’s principal operating subsidiary, as borrower, and affiliates (including the Company), as guarantors and/or borrowers, entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “New Credit Agreement”) with a group of commercial lenders led by Bank of the West (AMVAC’s primary bank) as agent, swing line lender and L/C issuer. The new facility also includes both AMVAC C.V. and AMVAC Netherlands BV (both Dutch subsidiaries) as borrowers. The New Credit Agreement supersedes the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (“First Amendment”) dated as of January 10, 2011. The New Credit Agreement is a senior secured lending facility with a five year term and consists of a revolving line of credit up to $200 million and an accordion feature for up to $100 million. In connection with AMVAC’s entering into the New Credit Agreement, all outstanding indebtedness under the First Amendment was rolled over into the New Credit Agreement, including the conversion of term loans into revolving debt.</p>

<p>On July 18, 2014, AMVAC, as borrower, and affiliates (including the Company), as guarantors and/or borrowers, entered into a First Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “First Amendment”) with a group of commercial lenders led by Bank of the West (AMVAC’s primary bank) as agent, swing line lender and L/C issuer. Under the First Amendment, the Consolidated Funded Debt Ratio was increased for the third and fourth quarters of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015, and, further, borrowers are permitted to pay cash dividends to shareholders during the first and second quarters of 2015 notwithstanding prior net income levels. Under the New Credit Agreement, the Company has three key covenants (with which it was in compliance throughout the year and as of December 31, 2014). The covenants are as follows: (1) the Company must maintain its borrowings below a certain consolidated funded debt ratio, (2) the Company has a limitation on its annual spending on the acquisition of fixed asset capital additions, and (3) the Company must maintain a certain consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio. The Company is in compliance with the above key covenants at December 31, 2014.</p>

<p>During 2014, the Company had in place one interest rate swap contract that ended on December 31, 2014. While in place, the interest rate swap contract was accounted for under FASB ASC 815 as a cash flow hedge. The effective portion of the gains or losses on the interest rate swap are reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. Losses in other comprehensive income that were expected to be reclassified to earnings in the coming 12 months were $564 and $689 at the end of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. As a result of the termination of the swap contract (as mentioned above), no balances remain in other comprehensive income at December 31, 2014. Up until the termination of the swap contract, the Company uses a pay fixed, receive 1Month LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) interest rate swap to manage the interest expense generated by variable rate debt. During 2014 and at December 31, 2013, the Company had in place an interest rate swap, the use of which results in a fixed interest rate of 1.73% for the portion of variable rate debt that is covered by the interest rate swap contract. This interest rate swap contract was put in place on March 30, 2011 and ended on December 31, 2014.</p>
