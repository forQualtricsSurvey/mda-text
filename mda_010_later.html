<p>Adjusted EBITDA</p>

<p>We use certain non-GAAP measures when reviewing our operating results, including adjusted EBITDA. We define adjusted EBITDA as operating income (loss) adjusted for certain non-cash items from the statement of cash flows and certain non-recurring items.</p>

<p>Our calculations of adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the components used in their calculations. We believe the presentation of adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure to help investors evaluate our capacity to fund our ongoing cash operating requirements, including capital expenditures and debt service obligations. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a substitute for operating income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP.</p>

<p>The following table includes a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to operating income (loss), the most comparable GAAP financial measure.</p>

<p>Historical Cash Flows</p>

<p>Our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 are summarized below:</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>Net cash flow from operating activities for 2014 was $196.4 million, compared to $19.7 million for 2013. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to $204 million higher adjusted EBITDA in 2014 compared to 2013, $3 million lower interest payments in 2014 compared to 2013 and $3 million lower pension contributions in 2014 compared to 2013. These increases in cash provided by operating activities were primarily offset by lower cash provided by changes in working capital, $19 million lower in 2014 compared to 2013, $11 million higher income tax payments in 2014 compared to 2013 and a one-time separation payment to our former CEO of $10 million paid in 2014.</p>

<p>Our cash flows from operating activities decreased to $19.7 million in 2013 from $37.1 million in 2012. The decrease in net cash from operating activities in 2013 was primarily due to $27 million lower adjusted EBITDA in 2013 compared to 2012, $9 million higher pension contributions in 2013 related to the PBGC settlement. In addition, in 2013, we paid a litigation settlement of $1.6 million; we received an insurance settlement of $7.9 million in 2012. Offsetting these decreases in cash flows, we received $8.1 million in net tax refunds in 2013 versus $13.7 million in net tax payments in 2012.</p>

<p>Our net cash used in investing activities for 2014 was $109.1 million, compared to $117.2 million for 2013. The decrease in cash used was due to $8.0 million lower capital expenditures in 2014 compared to 2013, $5 million lower capital expenditures for Vlissingen in 2014 compared to 2013 as the restart of Vlissingen was completed. These decreases were offset by a $5.7 million increase in acquisitions, with the $53.8 million purchase of the Mt. Holly smelter in 2014 compared to the acquisition of the Sebree smelter in 2013 for $48.1 million.</p>

<p>Our net cash used in investing activities in 2013 was $117.2 million compared to $32.5 million in 2012. The increase in cash used was due to the purchase of the Sebree smelter in 2013, for $48.1 million. In addition, increased capital expenditures in 2013 compared to 2012 accounted for an increase of $29.3 million, primarily for the Grundartangi expansion project and Vlissingen restart. Restricted cash deposits were $1.2 million higher in 2013 compared to 2012 and payments received from joint ventures were $6.6 million lower in 2013.</p>

<p>Our net cash used in financing activities for 2014 was $8.2 million, compared to $2.4 million for 2013. In 2014, cash used in financing activities was related to $6 million in net repayments of the amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facilities and the extinguishment of the remaining $2.6 million of our 7.5% Notes due in 2014. In addition, we received $0.4 million from the exercise of stock options.</p>

<p>Our net cash used in financing activities during 2013 was $2.4 million. The cash used was primarily related to the tender offer, consent solicitation and redemption of our 7.5% Notes due 2014 and issuance of our 7.5% Notes. The net cost of our long-term debt transactions in 2013 was $8.5 million, offset by net borrowings under our revolving credit facilities of $6.0 million.</p>
