<p>Results of Operations<br>
 <br>
For the results of operations discussed below, we compare the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 to the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2012.<br>
 <br>
Revenue from the sale of metals.  We recorded $10.7 million and $26.1 million of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, all from the sale of products from our Velardeña Properties in Mexico. The decrease in revenue from the sale of metals during 2013 as compared to 2012 is primarily the result of the suspension of mining and processing at our Velardeña Properties effective June 19, 2013, as discussed above.<br>
 <br>
Costs of metals sold.  We recorded $17.5 million and $33.4 million of costs applicable to sales for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, all from the sale of products from our Velardeña Properties in Mexico. The decrease in cost of metals sold during 2013 as compared to 2012 is primarily the result of the suspension of mining and processing at our Velardeña Properties effective June 19, 2013, as discussed above. Included in costs of metals sold for the period ended December 31, 2012 was a $2.7 million write down of finished goods inventory to estimated net realizable value.<br>
 <br>
Exploration Expense.  Our exploration expense, including property holding costs and allocated administrative expenses, totaled $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.  Exploration expense for both years was incurred primarily in Mexico, Peru, and Argentina (excluding amounts spent on the Yaxtché deposit at the El Quevar project) and includes property holding costs and costs incurred by our local exploration offices. The decrease in exploration expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 is the result of our reduced spending on exploration as we rationalized and monetized our exploration portfolio.<br>
 <br>
Velardeña Project Expense.  During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 we incurred approximately $3.1 million and $7.9 million of expenses, respectively, primarily related to construction of the San Mateo ramp, other mine construction and engineering work at our Velardeña Properties in Mexico.  In addition to amounts expensed during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we incurred capital expenditures of approximately $1.8 million and $9.5 million, respectively for plant construction, mining and other equipment. We suspended mining and processing at our Velardeña Properties effective June 19, 2013, as discussed above.<br>
 <br>
Velardeña shutdown and care and maintenance costs.  During the year ended December 31, 2013 we recorded a $6.4 million expense related to the severance of 440 positions and other shutdown and care and maintenance costs at our Velardeña Properties as the result of the suspension of mining and processing activities at the Velardeña Properties effective June 19, 2013.  We had no such charges during the year ended December 31, 2012.</p>

<p>El Quevar Project Expense.  During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 we incurred $2.6 million and $5.1 million of expenses, respectively, primarily related to furthering our evaluation of the Yaxtché deposit at our El Quevar project in Argentina. The reduction in costs for 2013 is primarily the result of placing the El Quevar project in a holding and maintenance state during 2013 while we actively solicit a partner to move the project forward. For both years, costs incurred for work performed outside of the Yaxtché deposit are included in “Exploration Expense” discussed above.<br>
 <br>
Administrative Expense.  Administrative expenses totaled $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Administrative expenses, including costs associated with being a public company, are incurred primarily by our corporate activities in support of the Velardeña Properties, El Quevar project and our exploration portfolio. The $5.6 million of administrative expenses we incurred during 2013 is comprised of $2.2 million of employee compensation and directors’ fees, $1.4 million of professional fees and $2.0 million of insurance, rents, travel expenses, utilities and other office costs. The $7.1 million of administrative expenses we incurred during 2012 is comprised of $2.9 million of employee compensation and directors’ fees, $1.7 million of professional fees and $2.5 million of insurance, travel expenses, rents, utilities and other office costs.<br>
 <br>
Stock based compensation.  During the year ended December 31, 2013 we incurred expense related to stock based compensation in the amount of $1.6 million compared to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Stock based compensation varies from period to period depending on the number and timing of shares granted, the type of grant, the market value of the shares on the date of grant and other variables.<br>
 <br>
Reclamation and accretion expense.  During the year ended December 31, 2013 we incurred $0.2 million of reclamation expense related to the accretion of an asset retirement obligation at the Velardeña Properties.  During the year ended December 31, 2012 we incurred $0.2 million of reclamation expense, which included $0.1 million of reclamation costs related to the accretion of an asset retirement obligation at the Velardeña Properties and actual reclamation expenses of $0.1 million incurred at the El Quevar project. During 2012 we completed a revised closure plan for our Velardeña Properties and recorded a reduction of the accretion of the asset retirement obligation of approximately $0.1 million which was netted against the expense for the period.<br>
 <br>
Impairment of long lived assets and goodwill.  We assess the recoverability of our long lived assets, including goodwill, at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may be impaired.  The significant decrease in metals prices during 2013 and the shutdown of mining and processing at the Velardeña Properties during June 2013 were events that required an assessment of the recoverability of the Velardeña Properties asset group and goodwill.  We completed an impairment analysis using a market valuation approach which relies upon assumptions related to the Velardeña Properties asset group in comparison to other corroborated observable market data.  At June 30, 2013 we determined that both the long lived assets and the goodwill associated with the Velardeña Properties and the San Diego property were impaired.  As a result at June 30, 2013 we recorded a $237.8 million impairment charge related to the long lived assets and an $11.2 million impairment charge related to goodwill.  At December 31, 2013 we reviewed the remaining carrying value of the long lived assets and goodwill based on the corroborated observable market data at that date and determined that the long lived assets and goodwill were further impaired.  As a result, at December 31, 2013 we recorded an additional $6.1 million impairment charge related to the long lived assets and a $0.5 million impairment charge related to goodwill which reduced the carrying value of the goodwill to zero.  During 2012, as the result of decreased gold and silver prices and changes to certain assumptions related to the long term plan for the Velardeña Properties we completed an impairment analysis of the goodwill carrying value, which indicated that goodwill was impaired. As a result of the impairment analysis we recorded goodwill impairments of $58.5 million, reducing the goodwill carrying value from $70.2 million to $11.7 million at December 31, 2012.<br>
 <br>
Other Operating Income, Net.  We recorded other operating income of $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The net amounts for both years consist primarily of net gains recorded on the sales of certain fixed assets and non strategic exploration properties.<br>
 <br>
Depreciation, depletion and amortization.  During the year ended December 31, 2013 we incurred depreciation, depletion and amortization expense of $6.9 million compared to $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Depreciation, depletion and amortization includes a $0.8 million write down of finished goods inventory to estimated net realizable value at December 31, 2012. There was no write down of finished goods inventory at December 31, 2013. The decrease in depreciation, depletion and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 is primarily the result of the impairment of long lived assets at the Velardeña Properties during 2013 which resulted in a significant decrease in the carrying value of property, plant and equipment.</p>

<p>Interest and Other Income.  During the year ended December 31, 2013 we recorded approximately $0.4 million of interest and other income primarily related to the reduction of a loss contingency liability related to foreign withholding taxes that the government could assert are owed by the Company, acting as withholding agent, on certain interest payments made to a third party. We recorded interest and other income of $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The 2012 amount is comprised of a $1.8 million gain on the sale of the Platosa net smelter royalty to Excellon, a $0.6 million reduction of the loss contingency liability discussed above and $0.1 million of income from tolling agreements at our Velardeña Properties.<br>
 <br>
Royalty Income.  During the year ended December 31, 2012 we recorded royalty income of approximately $0.4 million. The royalty income was all related to Excellon’s Platosa mine in Mexico, on which we retained a net smelter return royalty. We sold the net smelter return royalty to Excellon during the second quarter 2012.  At December 31, 2013 we had no other sources of royalty income and we did not record any royalty income during the year then ended.<br>
 <br>
Interest and Other Expense.  We recorded no interest and other expense during the year ended December 31, 2013. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded interest and other expense of $0.3 million comprised of $0.2 million related to interest incurred on a value added tax audit in Mexico and $0.1 million related to losses on investments.<br>
 <br>
Gain (Loss) on Foreign Currency.  We recorded a $0.6 million foreign currency loss for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to a $0.5 million foreign currency gain for the year ended December 31, 2012. Foreign currency gains and losses are primarily related to the effect of currency fluctuations on monetary assets net of liabilities held by our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than US dollars. Such foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities have increased with the acquisition of the Velardeña Properties.<br>
 <br>
Income Taxes.  For the year ended December 31, 2013 we recorded an income tax benefit of $49.7 million primarily related to the impairment of long lived assets during the year. Our income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $8.0 million primarily related to an increase in net operating losses and the amortization of the mineral deposit at our Velardeña Properties in Mexico.</p>
