<p>Electrical power represents owned by RTed a 12-month notice to terminate its long-term power supply agreement (the “Sebree Power Agreement”). On February 1, 2014, Sebree began taking power under a new market-based power contract, similar to the agreement we have reached for Hawesville, providing market-based power to the Sebree smelter. Under the arrangement, Kenergy and Big Rivers purchase power on the open market and pass it through to Sebree at MISO pricing plus transmission and other costs incurred by them.
