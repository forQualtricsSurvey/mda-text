<p>2013 Highlights<br>
 <br>
During the first six months of 2013 we focused our efforts primarily on mining and processing improvements at our Velardeña Properties. On June 19, 2013 we suspended mining and processing at the Velardeña Properties primarily due to decreased gold and silver prices in order to conserve the asset. We are continuing to evaluate alternative plans for a restart of our Velardeña Properties.  Our objective is to implement a mining and processing plan that at then current prices for silver and gold indicates a sustainable cash margin at the Velardeña Properties.  During 2013 we continued efforts to actively solicit a partner to advance our El Quevar project and rationalize our exploration portfolio.  We reduced general and administrative expenses in 2013 by 21% over 2012 expenses and we expect this reduced level of spending to continue in 2014.  We also are reviewing strategic opportunities, focusing on development or operating properties in North America, including Mexico.<br>
 <br>
Velardeña Properties<br>
 <br>
·                  Payable metals during the first six months of 2013 totaled approximately 393,000 silver equivalent ounces (equivalents calculated at 60:1 silver to gold) and included approximately 252,000 ounces of silver and 2,350 ounces of gold.  Payable silver equivalent ounces include only silver and gold.  During the first six months of 2013 we also sold approximately 500,000 pounds of payable lead and 706,000 pounds of payable zinc.  Our output increased by approximately 25% on a silver equivalent daily basis in the first half of the year compared to the previous year.<br>
 <br>
·                  On June 19, 2013 we suspended mining and processing at our Velardeña Properties in Mexico primarily due to decreased gold and silver prices.  We placed the mines and processing plants on a care and maintenance program to enable a restart when mining and processing plans and metals prices support a cash positive outlook.<br>
 <br>
·                  Prior to the suspension, we completed the San Mateo ramp at the Velardeña Properties, which provides access to the Santa Juana mining area. The completed ramp, which provides more efficient and less costly haulage capacity from the mine, should be helpful to the restart economic analysis. During the suspension period, we are using the ramp to access mining areas to construct and evaluate restart mining plans.<br>
 <br>
·                  Since the shutdown, we have continued to evaluate plans for a restart of mining at the Velardeña Properties, with the objective of implementing a plan that at then current prices for silver and gold indicates a sustainable cash margin for mining. We have been mapping and sampling veins underground containing higher grade shoots to verify mine modeling in support of restart planning.  We are analyzing the potential of mining from a combination of different veins at our Velardeña Properties based primarily on grades and metallurgy. Additionally, we are reviewing alternative high grade narrow vein mining methods to determine the most beneficial mining method for a potential restart. In these efforts, we are using our own technical personnel as well as independent third party consultants. During the first quarter 2014 we commenced a 5,000 meter underground drill program at the Velardeña mine in order to obtain additional information to assist us in creating our restart plan. We expect to receive the drill results in the second quarter 2014.<br>
 <br>
·                  During 2013 we continued to work on treatment options to improve gold recoveries from gold bearing pyrites. Testing to date for an autoclave process and roasting technologies has demonstrated significant improvement in recoveries but both of these processes require a larger scale mining project than data currently suggests is feasible. Other enhanced recovery technologies, including fine grinding and leaching, ferric chloride oxidation and leaching and other oxidation processes, have not demonstrated an economic benefit in lab testing thus far.  Our current efforts are focused on whether different types of pyrites can be separated to enhance gold recoveries.<br>
 <br>
·                  We also are actively searching for oxide feed from outside sources, which could enable us to restart the Velardena oxide plant ahead of and possibly during implementation of an economic restart plan.</p>

<p>El Quevar<br>
 <br>
·                  In early 2013, we completed a 2,400 meter, 16 hole drilling program at the Quevar North and South areas at El Quevar. Results may represent a significant extension of the previously defined Yaxtché deposit and a mineralized zone at Quevar North similar in structural control to the Yaxtché zone.  In order to advance El Quevar, the Company is actively soliciting a partner to move the project forward with additional drilling in these areas, drilling in other potential areas and evaluations.<br>
 <br>
Exploration Portfolio<br>
 <br>
·                  In the first quarter 2013, we acquired the 233 hectare Los Azules property in Chihuahua, Mexico.  In the fourth quarter 2013, we began drilling at the Los Azules property as part of a planned 2,000 meter phase one drill program to test down dip targets on the previously mined vein system. We are continuing to rehabilitate an underground access adit as required for our underground drilling program.  Based on initial drill results, we are planning in a phase two drill program.<br>
 <br>
·                  We have completed rationalization of our portfolio of exploration properties, realizing in 2012 and 2013 exploration property sales totaling approximately $9.0 million.  These sales, together with relinquishment of properties no longer of interest, have reduced our portfolio of about 80 properties containing about 730,000 hectares to about 30 properties containing about 150,000 hectares. Since 2011, we have reduced ongoing annual expenditures for the exploration program by approximately 75 percent.</p>
