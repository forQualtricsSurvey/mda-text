<p>Revenues and Expenses</p>

<p>We generate revenues primarily from filmed entertainment box office receipts and concession sales with additional revenues from screen advertising sales and other revenue streams, such as vendor marketing promotions, studio trailer placements, meeting rentals and electronic video games located in some of our theatres. NCM provides our domestic theatres with various forms of in theatre advertising. We also offer alternative entertainment, such as live and pre-recorded sports programs, concert events, the Metropolitan Opera, in-theatre gaming and other special events in our theatres through our joint venture, AC JV, LLC. Our Flix Media initiative has also allowed us to expand our screen advertising and alternative content within our international circuit and to other international exhibitors.</p>

<p>Films leading the box office during the year ended December 31, 2017 included Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Beauty and the Beast, Wonder Woman, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Spider Man: Homecoming, It, Thor: Ragnarok, Despicable Me 3, Logan, The Fate of the Furious, Justice League, Dunkirk, Coco, The LEGO Batman Movie, Get Out, The Boss Baby, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, Kong: Skull Island, Hidden Figures, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle and other films.</p>

<p>Films scheduled for release during 2018 include well-known franchise films such as Avengers: Infinity War, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Black Panther, The Incredibles 2, Deadpool 2, Ralph Breaks The Internet: Wreck-It Ralph, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, Mission Impossible 6, Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation, X-Men: Dark Phoenix, and Ant-Man and the Wasp, among other films.</p>

<p>Film rental costs are variable in nature and fluctuate with our admissions revenues. Film rental costs as a percentage of revenues are generally higher for periods in which more blockbuster films are released. Advertising costs, which are expensed as incurred, are primarily related to campaigns for new and renovated theatres and brand advertising that vary depending on the timing of such campaigns.</p>

<p>Concession supplies expense is variable in nature and fluctuates with our concession revenues. We negotiate prices for concession supplies directly with concession vendors and manufacturers to obtain volume rates.</p>

<p>Although salaries and wages include a fixed cost component (i.e. the minimum staffing costs to operate a theatre facility during non-peak periods), salaries and wages move in relation to revenues as theatre staffing is adjusted to respond to changes in attendance. In some international locations, staffing levels are also subject to local regulations.</p>

<p>Facility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment. Certain leases are subject to percentage rent only, while others are subject to percentage rent in addition to their fixed monthly rent if a target annual performance level is achieved. Facility lease expense as a percentage of revenues is also affected by the number of theatres under operating leases, the number of theatres under capital leases and the number of fee-owned theatres.</p>

<p>Utilities and other costs include both fixed and variable costs and primarily consist of utilities, expenses for projection and sound equipment maintenance and monitoring, property taxes, janitorial costs, repairs, maintenance and security services.</p>

<p>General &amp; administrative expenses are primarily fixed in nature and consists of the costs to support the overall management of the Company, including salaries and wages, incentive compensation and benefit costs for our corporate office personnel, facility expenses for our corporate offices, professional fees, audit fees, general supplies and other costs that are not specifically associated with the operations of our theatres.</p>
