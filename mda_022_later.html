<p>Results of Operations</p>

<p>2013 Compared with 2012:</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>During the months leading up to the 2013 planting season, most companies in the sector experienced heavy demand for their corn products, as growers anticipated another healthy season. As a result, many of these products—including herbicides, insecticides, fungicides and seed—were in such high demand, that suppliers were compelled to allocate their supply into the channel of distribution. In fact, an unprecedented number of these products were under allocation across the Midwest in both corn and soybeans. In the face of this demand, the Company experienced record sales of its corn products, including soil insecticides and herbicides, during the first quarter of 2013.</p>

<p>However, persistent spring rainfall in the Midwest region of the U.S., from February through May, caused considerable disruption to normal planting practices. In some areas of northern Iowa and southern Minnesota, flooded and muddy field conditions made it impractical to plant any crop at all. In other areas, wet weather caused such extensive delays in planting that growers were forced to switch their corn planting intentions over to soybeans. Throughout the region, many growers had such limited, clear weather planting opportunities that they chose to skip pre-emergent crop protection treatments altogether in order to concentrate on seed planting exclusively.</p>

<p>As a result of these circumstances, the distribution channel in the central U.S. accumulated inventory of crop input products in excess of normal levels; carryover inventory is estimated to be over 30% of annual sales volumes versus the historical level of approximately 20 to 25%. In light of this product carryover, some of our key customers in the distribution channel have exerted additional financial control over their working capital and applied additional constraints on procurement activities at the close of the financial year, as they sought to work down inventory levels.</p>

<p>Weather conditions and lower commodity prices in 2013 also resulted in a downturn in the number of U.S. acres planted in both cotton and peanuts, specifically, a two million acre reduction in cotton acres planted and a 30% drop in peanuts acres. Additionally, the wet spring weather caused some growers in the mid-south and southeast regions to switch from planting corn to soybeans. Since AMVAC supplies crop protection product for corn, cotton and peanuts but does not provide any products for soybeans, these commodity price and weather-related shifts diminished AVD’s year-over- year growth.</p>

<p>Overall financial performance for the year ended December 31, 2013 was mixed as compared to the same period in 2012, with net sales higher and net income lower. The Company’s total net sales for the period were up 4% to $381,021 compared to $366,190 for the year ended December 31, 2012. Net sales of our crop business in 2013 were $346,514, which constitutes an increase of 5% over the net sales of $329,540 for that business in 2012. Net sales of our non-crop products in 2013 were $34,507, which is a reduction of approximately 6% as compared to 2012. A more detailed discussion of product groups and products having a material effect on net sales for each of the crop and non-crop businesses appears below.</p>

<p>In our Crop business, net sales of insecticides in 2013 ended at $193,623, which was flat as compared to 2012. Within the Crop business, annual net sales of our granular soil insecticides were up 2% over 2012, driven by continued strong performance from our primary corn soil insecticides – Aztec®, Smartchoice® and Force, offset by year-over-year declines in Thimet due to reduced peanut acres and Counter which had somewhat lighter use in 2013 on corn and sugar beets. Our Mocap and Nemacur granular insecticides/nematicides benefited from increased demand in international markets. Among our non-granular insecticide products, net sales for crop applications declined by 3%, as less of our foliar cotton insecticide Bidrin was required on the reduced cotton acres planted in 2013. Sales of bifenthrin, permethrin and acephate remained relatively flat with the prior year.</p>

<p>Within the product group of herbicides/soil fumigants/fungicides, our crop net sales in 2013 were up 35% to $121,042 vs. $89,899 in 2012. Within this group, we had mixed results. The positive driver was our herbicide product category, up 146%, resulting from strong demand and ample supply availability for our post-emergent corn herbicide, Impact. Our co-marketing agreement with Monsanto continues to expand our market presence. Our fumigants sales volume, however, declined 2% as our Vapam and K-Pam® products were affected by some water shortages in certain markets.</p>

<p>Within our other products group (which includes plant growth regulators, molluscicides and third party manufacturing activity), we experienced a decrease of 30% in net sales during 2013, $31,849 vs. $45,581 in 2012. The major driver of this sales performance was Folex, a defoliant used in cotton harvest management. This product was impacted by the drop in cotton acres mentioned above. Most of the other products and functional activities captured in this group were relatively flat with the prior year.</p>

<p>Within our non-crop business, 2013 net sales were down by 6% to $34,507 vs. $36,650 recorded in 2012. Naled® sales (our Dibrom brand mosquito adulticide) were down slightly, and pest strips business was flat. Additionally, net sales of our PCNB fungicide for turf uses were stable. We experienced a decline in Pharmaceutical sales of approximately 9%, primarily due to generic competition from China.</p>

<p>Our cost of sales for 2013 was $209,674 or 55% of net sales. This compared to $205,065 or 56% of net sales for 2012. The decline in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales in 2013 arose primarily from these factors. In 2013 the Company continued to focus on continuing to limit volumes on products that have lower than average margins. Furthermore, in 2013 our sales team has focused on selling brands and tends to have stronger margins throughout the supply chain over the long term. As detailed in the table, the change in volume, mix, price and manufacturing activity resulted overall in a 1% improvement in gross margin to 45% in 2013 as compared to 44% for the same period of the prior year. This included the benefit of selling prices that increased on average by 4.7% offset by approximately 3.7% increase in raw material costs and manufacturing costs adjusted for the different mix of products manufactured and sold in 2013.</p>

<p>Operating expenses in 2013 increased by $13,810 to $115,612 or 30% of sales as compared to $101,802 or 28% in 2012. The differences in operating expenses by department are as follows:</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>•	 	Selling expenses increased by $7,060 to end at $32,929 for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to $25,869 in 2012. The main drivers for increased overall expenses were costs associated with expanding our international and domestic sales teams to better support the expanding business, field stewardship activities and increased advertising and promotion expenses in support of our leading brands. Our costs in 2013 also included expenses as a result of starting up the Envance majority owned subsidiary.<br>
 <br>
 	•	 	General and administrative expenses increased by $3,821 to $33,536 for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to $29,715 in 2012. The main drivers for the increase are primarily related to higher legal costs associated with a data compensation matter, which concluded in July 2013, other outside consulting services associated with domestic and international business development and additional personnel costs in support of our expanding business.<br>
 <br>
 	•	 	Research, product development costs and regulatory expenses increased by $894 to $21,644 for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to $20,750 in 2012. This change is primarily driven by increased activities on both product development and additional formulation and process chemistry projects offset by some lower regulatory expenses.<br>
 <br>
 	•	 	Freight, delivery and warehousing costs for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by $2,035 to $27,503, as compared to $25,468 in 2012. We continue to focus on managing logistics expenses throughout our supply chain. As a percentage of sales, freight costs increased to 7.2% of net sales during 2013, as compared to 7.0% of net sales during 2012.</p>

<p>Total Interest expense was $1,901 in 2013, as compared to $2,471 in 2012. Interest costs are summarized in the following table:</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>The Company’s average overall debt for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $52,872 as compared to $57,248 for the comparable period of the previous year. As can be seen from the above table, on a gross basis, our effective interest rate decreased to 3.4% as compared to 3.7% in 2012, due to lower interest rates on our new senior credit facility agreement. After deductions of capitalized interest and including expenses related to the amortization of deferred liabilities, our effective rate was 3.6% for 2013 as compared to 4.3% in 2012. Lower amortization of discounting on deferred liabilities related to product line acquisitions contributed to the reduction in our effective interest rate in 2013.</p>

<p>Income tax expense for 2013 amounted to $18,916 as compared to $20,026 for 2012. The 2013 effective tax rate was 35.1%, which is flat as compared to 2012. This is primarily due to the benefit from our international structure offset by decreased domestic production deduction.</p>

<p>The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the “Act”) was signed into law on January 2, 2013. The Act retroactively restored several expired business tax provisions, including the research and experimentation credit. Changes in tax laws are accounted for in the period of enactment, and the retroactive effect of the Act, on the Company’s U.S. federal taxes for 2012, amounted to a benefit of approximately $250, which has been recognized in 2013.</p>

<p>On our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013 we included losses on equity investment of $986. There were no such losses recorded in 2012. Furthermore, in 2013 we adjusted our net income attributable to American Vanguard by $517 for the non-controlling interest’s share of the net losses of our majority-owned subsidiary, Envance. In 2012, the adjustment to our net income attributable to American Vanguard for such losses was $41.</p>

<p>Net income attributable to American Vanguard decreased by 6.6% and ended at $34,449 or $1.19 per diluted share in 2013 as compared to $36,867 or $1.28 per diluted share in 2012.</p>
