<p>We are a global producer of primary aluminum. The aluminum industry is cyclical and the price of primary aluminum (which trades as a commodity) is determined by global supply and demand, among other factors. The key determinants of our results of operations and cash flow from operations are as follows:</p>

<p>•the price of primary aluminum, which is based on the LME, regional delivery premiums and any value-added product premiums;</p>

<p>•the cost of goods sold, the principal components of which are electrical power, alumina, carbon products and labor, which in aggregate exceed 75% of our cost of goods sold; and</p>

<p>•our production volume.</p>
