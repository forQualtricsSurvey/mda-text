<p>Electrical power represents our single largest operating cost. As a result, the availability of reliable electrical power at competitive prices is critical to the profitability and stability of our operations. Historically, our domestic operations relied on long-term fixed price power supply agreements, or more recently, power supply agreements based on tariff and/or cost-based pricing. Over the last several years, we have tried, with some success, to reduce our electrical power price risk by, amongst other tactics, attempting to enter into power contracts with LME pricing contingencies thereby reducing our power costs during periods of lower LME pricing. Meanwhile, our smelters in Kentucky and South Carolina faced some of the highest power tariffs for aluminum smelters in the United States. At the same time, developments in the U.S. power markets, driven partly by an abundance of natural gas available at low prices, have led to the availability of lower priced power in competitive wholesale markets.</p>

<p>In 2012, we began the process of moving toward market-based electrical power supply agreements for our domestic operations. In August 2012, we issued a 12-month notice to terminate CAKY&#x27;s long-term power supply agreement (the “Hawesville Power Agreement”). Pursuant to the termination notice, the Hawesville Power Agreement terminated on August 20, 2013. The KPSC approved a new power supply agreement with Kenergy and Big Rivers which provides market-based power to the Hawesville smelter, effective August 20, 2013. Under the arrangement, the power companies purchase power on the open market and pass it through to Hawesville at MISO pricing plus transmission and other costs incurred by them.</p>

<p>In January 2013, Sebree (then still owned by RTA) issued a 12-month notice to terminate its long-term power supply agreement (the “Sebree Power Agreement”). On February 1, 2014, Sebree began taking power under a new market-based power contract, similar to the agreement we have reached for Hawesville, providing market-based power to the Sebree smelter. Under the arrangement, Kenergy and Big Rivers purchase power on the open market and pass it through to Sebree at MISO pricing plus transmission and other costs incurred by them.</p>

<p>Amended terms of Mt. Holly&#x27;s power agreement allow Mt. Holly to receive all or a portion of Mt. Holly&#x27;s supplemental power requirements from an off-system natural gas-fired power generation facility (the “off-system facility”). The energy charge for supplemental power from the off-system facility is based on the cost of natural gas rather than Santee Cooper&#x27;s system average fuel costs, which are primarily coal-based. The amended power agreement provides that Mt. Holly may continue to receive its supplemental power requirements from the off-system facility through December 31, 2015. We are currently in discussions with Santee Cooper and other parties regarding power arrangements for Mt. Holly following December 31, 2015.</p>

<p>With the movement toward market-based power supply agreements, we have increased our electrical power price risk for our domestic operations. Changes in the price and/or availability of market power could significantly impact the profitability and viability of our Hawesville, Sebree and Mt. Holly operations. Transmission line outages, problems with grid stability or limitations on energy import capability could also increase power prices, disrupt production through pot instability or force a curtailment of all or part of the production at these facilities. In addition, indirect factors that lead to power cost increases, such as the increasing prices for natural gas or coal, fluctuations in or extremes in weather patterns (such as those experienced in January and February 2014) or new or more stringent environmental regulations may severely impact our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.</p>

<p>While we currently have not entered into any forward contracts to mitigate the price risk associated with our open market power purchases, we may manage our exposure by entering into certain forward contracts or option contracts in future periods.</p>
