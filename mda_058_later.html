<p>Contractual Obligations and Commitments<br>
 <br>
Contractual obligations at December 31, 2015 are as follows (in thousands):</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>(1)<br>
These amounts include cash and payment in kind (&quot;PIK&quot;) interest. Interest on the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 is payable semi-annually in cash at a rate of 5.75% per annum and in additional notes at a rate of 2.25% per annum. PIK interest is shown as due in the year the underlying debt is due. The maturity date of the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 is April 1, 2028; however the holders of these notes can require us to purchase any or all of the notes at par in cash on April 1, 2018. For purposes of this schedule, we show these notes as due in 2018 because of this put option. The table above does not consider other potential conversions as we cannot predict the amount, if any, of the notes that may be converted.<br>
 <br>
(2)<br>
Amounts include projected interest payments to be made in cash. Debt outstanding under our Facility Agreement bears interest at a floating rate and, accordingly, we estimated our interest costs in future periods. Amounts also include projected cash interest to be paid on the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 through the first put date of April 1, 2018.</p>

<p>(3)<br>
We have purchase commitments with Thales, Ericsson, and Hughes related to the procurement, deployment and maintenance of our second-generation network. See Note 6: Commitments in our Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion on these contractual commitments.</p>

<p>(4)<br>
In June 2012, we settled our prior commercial disputes with Thales, including those disputes that were the subject of an arbitration award, for €17,530,000. This amount represented one-third of the termination charges awarded to Thales in the arbitration. The payment is due on the later of the effective date of the new contract for the purchase of additional second-generation satellites and the occurrence of the effective date of the financing for the purchase of these satellites and the first draw from the financing. We included this amount in 2016 above, although the timing of any payment is indefinite and undeterminable. For purposes of the table above, we converted the termination charge to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2015. See Note 7: Contingencies in our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.</p>

<p>(5)<br>
In August 2013, pursuant to an amendment and restatement of the Facility Agreement, we paid the lenders a restructuring fee plus an additional underwriting fee to COFACE in the aggregate amount of approximately $13.9 million, representing 40% of the total restructuring and underwriting fee; the balance of $20.8 million is due no later than December 31, 2017. We include this remaining amount in noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.</p>

<p>(6)<br>
We have signed various licensing and royalty agreements necessary for the manufacture and distribution of our second-generation products, which are expected to be introduced in 2016. We will pay or have paid license fees for new product technology with royalty fees payable on a per unit basis as these units are manufactured, sold, or activated.</p>
