<p>Capital Expenditures<br>
 <br>
We have entered into various contractual agreements, primarily with Hughes and Ericsson, related to the procurement and deployment of our second-generation gateways and other ground facilities.<br>
 <br>
Our agreements with Hughes are related to design, supply and implementation of RAN ground network equipment and software upgrades for installation at a number of our satellite gateway ground stations and satellite interface chips to be used in various second-generation devices.</p>

<p>In March 2015, we entered into an agreement with Hughes for the design, development, build, testing and delivery of four custom test equipment units for a total of $1.9 million. Hughes delivered this test equipment during the fourth quarter of 2015. In April 2015, we extended the scope of work for delivery of two additional RANs for a total of $4.0 million. These RANs were delivered in February 2016.</p>

<p>In April 2015, Hughes exercised its option to accept shares of our common stock (at a price 7% below market) in lieu of cash for certain of our remaining contract milestones, including milestones related to the 2015 work mentioned above, totaling approximately $15.5 million. In June 2015, we issued 7.4 million shares of freely tradable common stock at a 7% discount pursuant to this option. We recorded a loss equal to the value of the 7% discount of $1.2 million in our consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2015. In the April 2015 agreement (as amended), we agreed to provide downside protection through March 31, 2016. This feature requires that we issue additional shares of common stock equal to the difference, if any, between $15.5 million and the total amount of gross proceeds Hughes receives from the sale of any shares plus the market value of any shares still held by Hughes as of the close of trading on March 31, 2016. Pursuant to this agreement, we recorded a $5.5 million liability as of December 31, 2015 based on an estimate of the value of this option calculated using a Black-Scholes pricing model. We mark this liability to market at each balance sheet date and through the settlement date. We recorded this estimated loss in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.</p>

<p>In July 2015, we formally amended the contract with Hughes to include the revised scope of work set forth in the March 2015 and April 2015 letter agreements. We reflect the additional $1.9 million for delivery of four custom test equipment units and the $4.0 million for delivery of two additional RANs agreed to in March and April 2015, respectively, in the contract through this amendment.</p>

<p>Our agreements with Ericsson are related to development, implementation and maintenance of a ground interface, or core network system, which will be installed at a number of our satellite gateway ground stations. In July 2014, we signed an amended and restated contract to specify the remaining contract value and a new milestone schedule to reflect a revised program time line. Prior to the amended and restated contract being finalized, we made an agreement with Ericsson that deferred certain milestone payments previously due under the 2008 contract to 2014 and beyond. The deferred payments were incurring interest at a rate of 6.5% per annum. In April 2015, we signed an amendment to the 2014 contract to incorporate certain changes in scope and timing identified as necessary by the parties. In conjunction with signing this amendment, we executed a new letter agreement under which Ericsson agreed to waive the remaining $1.0 million in deferred milestone payments and $0.4 million in interest accrued on the milestone payments under the 2008 contract. In the first quarter of 2015, we reversed these amounts from accounts payable, accrued expenses and construction in progress on our consolidated balance sheet. In August 2015, we executed a second amendment to the 2014 contract which incorporates revised payment and pricing schedules. This amendment also reflects an accelerated time line for the project such that the work is estimated to be completed in the second quarter, instead of the third quarter, of 2016. As of December 31, 2015, the remaining amount due under the contract is $7.6 million.</p>

<p>The following table presents the amount of actual and contractual capital expenditures for our contracts with Hughes and Ericsson related to the construction of the ground components and related product costs and includes payments made in both cash and stock (in thousands):</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>As of December 31, 2015, we recorded $1.9 million of these capital expenditures in accrued expenses.</p>

<p>In addition to the contractual agreements mentioned above, we have a contract with Thales for the construction of the second-generation low-earth orbit satellites and related services. We successfully completed the launches of our second-generation satellites. We are engaged in ongoing discussions with Thales regarding certain deliverables under the contract.</p>
