<p>Results of Operations</p>

<p>2012 Compared with 2011:</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>The 2012 agricultural market conditions were somewhat better than those of 2011. Persistent strong global demand for food, animal feed, natural fiber and bio-fuel feed stocks continued to spur higher than normal crop commodity prices. As a result, growers invested more heavily in yield enhancing inputs which fueled demand for many of the Company’s most important crop protection products. This was particularly true in corn, where strong demand and a rising crop commodity price led to increased planted acreage in the United States. In 2012, a record 97 million acres of corn were planted; over 87 million acres were harvested; and yield per acre was depressed to approximately 123 bushels from an average yield of closer to 150 bushels in prior years. The drop in yield arose from a persistent drought in parts of the Midwest and Southwest.</p>

<p>This extreme mid-season and late-season drought did not affect the use of the Company’s important granular soil insecticides since these products are applied at the time of planting. The drought of 2012 also affected U.S. cotton growers and destroyed nearly 23% of planted acreage, mostly in Texas. However, in other Southern and Southeastern states weather conditions were somewhat more favorable, allowing AMVAC to achieve excellent sales of its cotton insecticides and harvest defoliants.</p>

<p>Adding to the challenges of meeting excess demand and coping with problematic weather, the continuing practice of planting corn on the same acres year-after-year (versus sequential rotation of corn and soybeans) has intensified primary &amp; secondary insect pest pressure in the Midwest United States. Furthermore, over the past few seasons, growers (particularly of corn) have increasingly adopted the use of conventional chemistry as an important part of integrated pest management, both to control resistant pests and to help improve yield. Additionally, with the widespread use of glyphosate herbicides over the last 15 years, many growers are having to cope with hard-to-control weeds &amp; grasses through other means, including complementary herbicides. As a result, the Company has experienced increased demand for its soil insecticides and post-emergent herbicide products for corn.</p>

<p>Overall financial performance (including net sales and net income) for the year ended December 31, 2012 improved as compared to the same period in 2011. The Company’s total net sales for the period were up 22% to $366,190 compared to $301,080 for the year ended December 31, 2011. Net sales of our crop business in 2012 were $329,540, which constitutes an increase of 21% over the net sales of $272,068 for that business in 2011. Net sales of our non-crop products in 2012 were $36,650, which constitutes an increase of 26% over the net sales of $29,012 in the same period last year. A more detailed discussion of product groups and products having a material effect on net sales for each of the crop and non-crop segments appears below.</p>

<p>In our Crop business, net sales of insecticides in 2012 increased to $194,060 which represents a 41% increase as compared to $137,460 for the comparable period in 2011. This included approximately 6% related to price and 35% to increased volume. Within this business, annual net sales of our granular soil insecticides were up more than 50% over 2011, driven by a strong performance from our primary corn soil insecticides—Aztec, Smartchoice®, Counter® and Force. Our Mocap and Nemacur granular insecticides/nematicides benefited from an average 3% selling price increase and remained relatively flat on volume with improved supply of Mocap, offsetting some volume shortfall on Nemacur. Annual net sales of Thimet grew by nearly 33% over the prior year including approximately 5% related to price, primarily on peanut acres, in sugar cane fields and as a preferred substitute for a withdrawn competitive insecticide (aldicarb). Among our non-granular insecticide products, net sales for crop applications grew by 11% led by our foliar cotton insecticide Bidrin. Sales of bifenthrin, permethrin and acephate remained flat with the prior year, as we continued to de-emphasize the applications of these products that have become susceptible to low-priced generic competition.</p>

<p>Within the product group of herbicides/soil fumigants/fungicides, our crop net sales in 2012 were down about 1% to $89,899 vs. $90,782 in 2011. Within this group, we had mixed results. Net sales of our herbicide products were down 24%, resulting from the timing of sales and supply availability for our post-emergent corn herbicide, Impact. Actual “on-the-ground” use of Impact increased 22% in 2012 despite supply limitations and the effects of the severe Midwest summer drought. Our fumigants sales volume increased approximately 3% as our Vapam and K-Pam® products continue to be domestic market leaders in this product category. Net sales of our fungicides were up 36% in 2012, as we continue to recapture market share in potatoes with our PCNB product range. There were no price increases on PCNB.</p>

<p>Within the other products group (which includes plant growth regulators, molluscicides and third party manufacturing activity), we experienced an increase of 4% in net sales during 2012, $45,581 vs. $43,826 in 2011. We had record sales performance for Folex, a defoliant used in cotton harvest management. This included slightly lower overall volumes in line with cotton acres harvested but increased pricing as the market recognized the benefits of this brand. NAA®, our leading plant growth regulator, primarily used in apples to stop apple drop, the return of bloom and later in the season for thinning blossom, had a significant gain of 31%. Net sales of metaldehyde, (a molluscicide) were up 5% over the comparable 2011 period; and third party manufacturing revenues decreased by approximately 28% in 2012 as compared to 2011.</p>

<p>Within our non-crop business, 2012 net sales were up over 26% to $36,650 vs. $29,012 compared to 2011. Naled® sales (our Dibrom brand mosquito adulticide) were up by 19% (including average 6% selling price increase), with moderate storm and hurricane activity and despite continued drought conditions in portions of the Southeast. Net sales of pest strips increased 20% in volume and approximately 4% in selling price as compared to the prior year, as professional pest control operators continue to recognize that these products are among the most effective residual pest deterrents in commercial applications. Additionally, net sales of our PCNB fungicide for turf uses tripled, as we continue to recover market share following our reentry to the market. The Company has yet to re-enter the Canadian market following the expiration of its registration at the end of 2010. We are also pleased to report that initial sales from Envance (our new Joint Venture with TyraTech) were recorded in the weeks leading up to December 31, 2012. The business sells very effective organic aerosol products through Home Depot stores. These products target crawling, flying or stinging insects. Offsetting these gains, we experienced a decline in Pharmaceutical sales of approximately 26% primarily due to generic competition from China.</p>

<p>Our cost of sales for 2012 was $205,065 or 56% of net sales. This compared to $178,012 or 59% of net sales for 2011. The decline in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales in 2012 arose primarily from these factors. In 2012 the Company continued to focus on selling those products having higher margins or lower costs. This included a further drop in manufacturing activities for third parties as increased demand for plant capacity generated less incentive to drive this aspect of the business. Typically, such activities enable us to cover costs but do not generate much, if any, gross profit. Furthermore, our sales in 2012 have been focused on our strongest brands that are targeted at specific problems that have been impacting agriculture in the year and products that tend to have strong margin performance throughout the supply chain. As detailed in the table, the change in volume, mix, price and manufacturing activity resulted overall in a 3% improvement in gross margin to 44% in 2012 as compared to 41% for the same period of the prior year. This included the benefit of selling prices that increased on average by 5% offset by approximately 2% increase in raw material costs.</p>

<p>Operating expenses in 2012 increased by $17,960 to $101,802 or 28% of sales as compared to $83,842 or 28% in 2011. The differences in operating expenses by department are as follows:</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>•	 	Selling expenses increased by $2,551 to end at $25,869 for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to the same period of 2011. The main driver for increased overall cost was from expenses in support of our proprietary delivery system and other stewardship activities, wages, and travel expenses to support our growing business.<br>
 <br>
 	•	 	General and administrative expenses increased by $8,286 to $29,715 for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to the same period of 2011. The main reasons for the increased costs are; first, stock based and incentive compensation as a result of our improved overall financial performance; second, legal and consulting costs related to product defense, creation of our new international structure and creation of our new majority owned subsidiary; third, additional headcount supporting our expanding business.<br>
 <br>
 	•	 	Research, product development costs and regulatory expenses increased by $2,709 to $20,750 for the year ended December 31, 2012, as compared to the same period of 2011. This is mainly due to product defense and development cost in support of our expanding business plus key product development and research headcount.<br>
 <br>
 	•	 	Freight, delivery and warehousing costs for the year ended December 31, 2012 were $25,468 or 7% of sales as compared to $21,054 or 7% of sales for the same period in 2011.<br>
Total Interest expense was $2,471 in 2012, as compared to $3,457 in 2011. Interest costs are summarized in the following table:</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>The Company’s average overall debt for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $57,248 as compared to $72,908 for the comparable period of the previous year. During 2012 we operated the business without accessing our revolving debt facility by continued focus on inventory, receivables and program management. As can be seen from the above table, on a gross basis, our effective interest rate increased to 3.7% as compared to 3.4% last year. The increase is caused by the fixed interest rate swap, which is required as part of the Company’s credit agreement. After deductions of capitalized interest and including expenses related to the amortization of deferred liabilities, our effective rate was 4.3% for 2012 as compared to 4.7% in 2011. This is a reduction in comparison to the prior year primarily as a result of lower amortization of discounting on deferred liabilities related to product line acquisitions.</p>

<p>Income tax expense for 2012 amounted to $20,026 as compared to $13,155 for 2011. The 2012 effective tax rate was 35.2%, as compared to an effective rate of 37.3% for 2011. The decrease in effective tax rate is primarily due to increased benefit from domestic production activities, Alabama income tax capital credit and the deductible stock based compensation.</p>

<p>Net income attributable to American Vanguard increased 67% ended at $36,867 or $1.28 per diluted share in 2012 as compared to $22,068 or $0.79 per diluted share in 2011.</p>
