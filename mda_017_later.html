<p>Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates<br>
 <br>
The selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as the accounting rules have changed. Accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives, but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules, and the use of judgment, to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business. Discussed below are the accounting policies that we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being reported.<br>
 <br>
Mineral Reserves<br>
 <br>
When and if we determine that a mineral property has proven and probable reserves, subsequent development costs are capitalized to mineral properties. When mineral properties are developed and operations commence, capitalized costs are charged to operations using the units-of-production method over proven and probable reserves. “Mineralized material” as used in this annual report, although permissible under SEC’s Industry Guide 7, does not indicate “reserves” by SEC standards, and therefore all development costs incurred by us are expensed when incurred. The Company cannot be certain that any part of the deposits at the Velardeña Properties or the Yaxtché deposit at the El Quevar project will ever be confirmed or converted into SEC Industry Guide 7 compliant “reserves”.<br>
 <br>
Asset Retirement Obligations<br>
 <br>
We record asset retirement obligations in accordance with Auditing Standards Codification (“ASC”) 410, “Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations” (“ASC 410”), which establishes a uniform methodology for accounting for estimated reclamation and abandonment costs. According to ASC 410, the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation (“ARO”) is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. An offsetting asset retirement cost is capitalized as part of the carrying value of the assets with which it is associated, and depreciated over the useful life of the asset.<br>
 <br>
Long Lived Assets and Goodwill<br>
 <br>
We assess the recoverability of our long lived assets, including goodwill, at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may be impaired.  The significant decrease in metals prices during 2013 and the shutdown of mining and processing at the Velardeña Properties during June 2013 were events that required an assessment of the recoverability of the Velardeña Properties asset group and goodwill.  We completed an impairment analysis using a market valuation approach which relies upon assumptions related to the Velardeña Properties asset group in comparison to other corroborated observable market data.  At June 30, 2013 we determined that both the long lived assets and the goodwill associated with the Velardeña Properties and the San Diego property were impaired.  As a result at June 30, 2013 we recorded a $237.8 million impairment charge related to the long lived assets and an $11.2 million impairment charge related to goodwill.  At December 31, 2013 we reviewed the remaining carrying value of the long lived assets and goodwill based on the corroborated observable market data at that date and determined that the long lived assets and goodwill were further impaired.  As a result, at December 31, 2013 we recorded an additional $6.1 million impairment charge related to the long lived assets and a $0.5 million impairment charge related to goodwill which reduced the carrying value of the goodwill to zero.</p>
