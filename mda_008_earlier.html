<p>Liquidity</p>

<p>Our principal sources of liquidity are available cash, cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. We have also raised capital in the past through the public equity and debt markets, and we regularly explore various other financing alternatives. Our principal uses of cash are the funding of operating costs (including postretirement benefits), maintenance of curtailed production facilities, payments of principal and interest on our outstanding debt, the funding of capital expenditures, investments in our growth activities and in related businesses, working capital and other general corporate requirements.</p>

<p>Our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2013 was approximately $84 million compared to $184 million at December 31, 2012. Century&#x27;s U.S. revolving credit facility matures in May 2018 and our Iceland revolving credit facility matures in November 2016. As of December 31, 2013 our credit facilities had $6 million in amounts outstanding and approximately $112 million of net availability. As of December 31, 2013, we had approximately $71 million of letters of credit outstanding under our U.S. revolving credit facility. Future curtailments of production capacity would reduce accounts receivable and inventory, which comprise the borrowing base of our revolving credit facilities, and could result in a corresponding reduction in availability under the revolving credit facilities. The acquisition of the Sebree smelter increased domestic accounts receivable and inventory and resulted in a corresponding increase in availability under the U.S. revolving credit facility.</p>

<p>We have $250 million in 7.5% senior secured notes payable that will mature on June 1, 2021. Our remaining 7.5% senior unsecured notes due August 2014 will reach maturity this year, and we expect to make a $2.6 million repayment to retire these notes.</p>

<p>In 2012 and 2013, Nordural ehf participated in the 50/50 ISK Auctions (the “Auctions”) sponsored by the Central Bank of Iceland (“CBI”) and may participate in future auctions. The Auctions allow authorized investors to exchange foreign currency for ISK with 50% exchanged at the official rate set by the CBI and 50% exchanged at the auction rate. The ISK received in the Auction must be invested in Iceland for a minimum of five years.</p>

<p>We may be required to make installment payments for the E.ON contingent obligation in the future. These payments are contingent based on the LME price of primary aluminum and the level of Hawesville’s operations. Based on the LME forward market at December 31, 2013 and management’s estimate of the LME forward market beyond the quoted market period, we currently believe that we will not be required to make payments on the E.ON contingent obligation during the term of the agreement through 2028. There can be no assurance that circumstances will not change thus accelerating the timing of such payments. See Note 5 Derivative and hedging instruments and Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information.</p>

<p>In August 2011, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program. Through December 31, 2013, we had expended approximately $50 million under the program, but no repurchases have been made since March 2012. At December 31, 2013, we had approximately $10 million remaining under the repurchase program authorization. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.</p>

<p>In April 2013, we entered into a settlement agreement with the PBGC regarding an alleged “cessation of operations” at our Ravenswood facility as a result of the curtailment of operations at the facility. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we will make additional contributions (above any minimum required contributions) to our defined benefit pension plans over the term of the agreement, which runs through 2016. The remaining contributions under this agreement are approximately $10.7 million, of which approximately $3.7 million is due in 2014. Under certain circumstances, in periods of low primary aluminum prices relative to our operations, we may defer one or more of these payments, but we would be required to provide the PBGC with acceptable security for any deferred payments.</p>

<p>In addition to the contributions required pursuant to the PBGC settlement, based on current actuarial and other assumptions, we expect to make minimum required contributions to the qualified defined benefit plans and unqualified supplemental executive retirement benefits (“SERB”) plan of approximately $4.6 million and $1.8 million, respectively, for total pension contributions of $10.1 million during 2014. We may choose to make additional contributions to these plans from time to time at our discretion.</p>

<p>Under an agreement with the Government of Iceland, Nordural Grundartangi ehf agreed to prepay taxes during 2012, 2011 and 2010 as an advance levy of income taxes and other governmental taxes for the period of 2013 through 2018. In November 2013, the total prepaid amount of approximately $9.5 million was refunded to Nordural Grundartangi ehf, with approximately $1.3 million credited against taxes due in 2013.</p>

<p>We pay withholding taxes for intercompany dividend payments in Iceland. On November 1, 2013, we received a refund of the withholding taxes paid in 2012 and the first quarter of 2013 totaling approximately $21.7 million. In November 2014, we expect to receive a refund for withholding taxes paid in 2013 of $9.8 million. The withholding taxes and associated refunds are payable in ISK and we are subject to foreign currency risk associated with fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared the ISK.</p>

<p>In December 2013, we received a ruling in the arbitration of a lawsuit filed by our former Chief Executive Officer, Logan Kruger. In its ruling, the arbitration panel awarded Mr. Kruger approximately $8.7 million in severance payments, plus accrued interest. We made the severance payment in the first quarter of 2014 and no additional payments related to this issue are expected in future periods.</p>

<p>In May 2013, we received a US federal income tax refund of $5.0 million upon the notification from the Internal Revenue Service that it had finalized the review of our federal income tax returns for the tax years 2008, 2009, and 2010 and refund years of 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007.</p>

<p>In June 2012, Nordural Grundartangi ehf entered into a new supplemental power contract with Landsvirkjun. The supplemental power contract, which will expire in October 2029 (or upon the occurrence of certain earlier events), will provide Nordural Grundartangi ehf with supplemental power, as Nordural Grundartangi ehf may request from time to time, at LME-based variable rates. Nordural Grundartangi ehf has agreed to make certain prepayments to Landsvirkjun for power expected to be used at a later date in connection with the contract, which will reduce the price paid for power at the time of consumption. As of December 31, 2013, these power prepayments totaled approximately $2.0 million. We expect the amount of the prepayment to continue to grow slowly and we do not expect to realize the benefits from the prepayments in the near term.</p>
