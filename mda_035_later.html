<p>Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016</p>

<p>Revenues. Total revenues increased $72.8 million to $2,991.6 million for 2017 from $2,918.8 million for 2016, representing a 2.5% increase. The table below, presented by reportable operating segment, summarizes our year-over-year revenue performance and certain key performance indicators that impact our revenues.</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>(1)<br>
Revenue and attendance amounts in millions. Average ticket price is calculated as admissions revenues divided by attendance. Concession revenues per patron is calculated as concession revenues divided by attendance.<br>
(2)<br>
U.S. operating segment revenues include eliminations of intercompany transactions with the international operating segment. See Note 18 of our consolidated financial statements.<br>
(3)<br>
Constant currency revenue amounts, which are non-GAAP measurements, were calculated using the average exchange rates for the corresponding months for 2016. We translate the results of our international operating segment from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates from one period to the next can result in meaningful variations in reported results.   We are providing constant currency amounts for our international operating segment to present a period-to-period comparison of business performance without the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.<br>
•<br>
U.S. Admissions revenues decreased $22.1 million primarily due to a 4.5% decrease in attendance, partially offset by a 3.0% increase in average ticket price. Concession revenues increased $25.5 million primarily due to an 8.1% increase in concession revenues per patron, partially offset by the 4.5% decrease in attendance. The decrease in attendance was due to a slate of films in 2017 that had weaker consumer appeal compared to 2016, partially offset by the favorable impact of luxury lounger conversions and new theatres. The increase in average ticket price was primarily due to price increases. The increase in concession revenues per patron was primarily due to incremental sales, expanded offerings, price increases and new theatres.    <br>
•<br>
International. Admissions revenues increased $27.9 million as reported, primarily due to an 8.9% increase in average ticket price, partially offset by a 1.9% decrease in attendance. Admissions revenues increased $16.5 million in constant currency, primarily due to a 6.1% increase in constant currency average ticket price, partially offset by the 1.9% decrease in attendance. Concession revenues increased $23.2 million as reported, primarily due to a 12.0% increase in concession revenues per patron, partially offset by the 1.9% decrease in attendance.  Concession revenues increased $17.9 million in constant currency, primarily due to a 9.7% increase in constant currency concession revenues per patron, partially offset by the 1.9% decrease in attendance. The decrease in attendance was due to a slate of films in 2017 that had weaker consumer appeal compared to 2016, partially offset by the impact of new theatres. Average ticket price and concession revenues per patron increased primarily due to price increases, which were predominantly driven by local inflation. Other revenues increased primarily due to increased promotional income and incremental screen advertising revenues generated by an expansion of our Flix Media services to affiliates in various countries.</p>

<p>Cost of Operations. The table below summarizes certain of our theatre operating costs by reportable operating segment (in millions) for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017.</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>(1)<br>
Constant currency expense amounts, which are non-GAAP measurements, were calculated using the average exchange rates for the corresponding months for 2016. We translate the results of our international operating segment from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates from one period to the next can result in meaningful variations in reported results. We are providing constant currency amounts for our international operating segment to present a period-to-period comparison of business performance without the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.<br>
•<br>
U.S. Film rentals and advertising costs were $756.4 million, or 55.7% of admissions revenues, for 2017 compared to $768.9 million, or 55.8% of admissions revenues, for 2016. The decrease in the film rentals and advertising rate was primarily due to a higher concentration of blockbuster films during 2016. Concession supplies expense was $112.8 million, or 14.3% of concession revenues, for 2017 compared to $107.3 million, or 14.0% of concession revenues, for 2016. The increase in the concession supplies rate was primarily due to the impact of our expanded concession offerings.</p>

<p>Salaries and wages increased to $265.8 million for 2017 from $248.2 million for 2016 primarily due to incremental staffing at new and recently remodeled theatres, increases in minimum wages and increased staffing for food and beverage initiatives. Facility lease expense increased to $241.0 million for 2017 from $240.7 million for 2016 due to the impact of new theatres. Utilities and other costs decreased to $241.6 million for 2017 from $250.9 million for the 2016 period.  The decrease was primarily due to the change in classification of transactional fees and decreased equipment lease expenses for 3-D presentations.  <br>
•<br>
International. Film rentals and advertising costs were $210.1 million ($205.1 million in constant currency), or 48.0% of admissions revenues, for 2017 compared to $193.8 million, or 47.2% of admissions revenues, for 2016. The increase in the film rentals and advertising rate was primarily due to higher advertising costs during 2017.  Concession supplies expense was $53.5 million ($52.3 million in constant currency), or 21.5% of concession revenues, for 2017 compared to $47.2 million, or 20.9% of concession revenues, for 2016. The increase in the concession supplies rate was primarily due to the mix of concession products sold.</p>

<p>Salaries and wages increased to $88.7 million ($88.2 million in constant currency) for 2017 from $77.6 million for 2016. The as reported increase was due to increased local currency wage rates primarily due to inflation, new theatres and limited flexibility in scheduling staff caused by shifting government regulations.  Facility lease expense increased to $87.2 million ($84.6 million in constant currency) for 2017 from $80.6 million for 2016. The as reported increase was due to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate and new theatres. Utilities and other costs increased to $113.4 million ($111.6 million in constant currency) for 2017 from $105.0 million for 2016. The as reported increase was due to new theatres, increases in repairs and maintenance expenses and utility expenses and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate.</p>

<p>General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased to $153.3 million for 2017 from $143.4 million for 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased salaries and wages partially due to inflation, professional fees and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate.</p>

<p>Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense was $237.5 million for 2017 compared to $209.1 million for 2016. The increase was primarily due to depreciation expense related to theatre remodels and new theatres.</p>

<p>Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. We recorded asset impairment charges on assets held and used of $15.1 million for 2017 compared to $2.8 million for 2016. Impairment charges for 2017 consisted of theatre properties in the U.S., Colombia, Brazil, Guatemala and Curacao, impacting fifteen of our twenty-seven reporting units. Impairment charges for 2016 consisted of theatre properties in the U.S., Colombia and Ecuador, impacting fourteen of our twenty-seven reporting units. The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during each of the periods presented were specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre. See Notes 1 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements.</p>

<p>Loss on Sale of Assets and Other. We recorded a loss on sale of assets and other of $22.8 million during 2017 compared to $20.4 million during 2016. The loss recorded during 2017 included the retirement of assets due to theatre remodels and closures and the write-off of a favorable lease intangible asset due to the amendment of a theatre lease, partially offset by gains related to the sale of excess land parcels and a gain on a landlord buyout of a theatre lease.  The loss recorded during 2016 included the retirement of assets due to theatre remodels and closures, partially offset by a gain on the sale of our investment in RealD stock (see Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements) and a gain on the sale of a land parcel.</p>

<p>Interest Expense. Interest costs incurred, including amortization of debt issue costs, were $105.9 million for 2017 compared to $108.3 million for 2016. The decrease was due to the redemption of our previously outstanding $200.0 million 7.375% senior subordinated notes (the “7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes”) funded by a $225.0 million add-on to our 4.875% senior notes (the “4.875% Senior Notes), which occurred on March 21, 2016, as well as amendments to our senior secured credit facility completed during June and December of 2016 and June of 2017, which, in the aggregate, reduced the rate at which our term loan accrues interest by 100 basis points.  See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of our long-term debt.</p>

<p>Foreign Currency Exchange Gain. We recorded a foreign currency exchange gain of $0.9 million during 2017 and a foreign currency exchange gain of $6.5 million during 2016 primarily related to intercompany transactions and changes in exchange rates from the original transaction date until cash settlement. See Notes 1 and 12 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of foreign currency translation.</p>

<p>Loss on Debt Amendments and Refinancing. We recorded a loss of $0.5 million during 2017 related to amendments to our senior secured credit facility that included a reduction in the interest rate at which our term loan accrues interest, revisions to certain definitions within the agreement, a reduction of the interest rates applicable to the revolving credit line and an extension of the maturity of the revolving credit line. We recorded a loss of $13.4 million during 2016 primarily related to the early redemption of our $200.0 million 7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of our long-term debt.<br>
Distributions from NCM. We recorded distributions received from NCM of $16.4 million during 2017 and $14.7 million during 2016, which were in excess of the carrying value of our Tranche 1 Investment. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.</p>

<p>Equity in Income of Affiliates. We recorded equity in income of affiliates of $36.0 million during 2017 and $32.0 million during 2016. See Notes 5 and 6 to our consolidated financial statements for information about our equity investments.</p>

<p>Income Taxes. Income tax expense of $79.4 million was recorded for 2017 compared to $103.8 million recorded for 2016. The effective tax rate for 2017 was 23.0%, which included the impact of a one-time benefit of $44.9 million related to the enactment of the Tax Act. See Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.  The effective tax rate for 2016 was 28.8%.  We expect the effective tax rate for 2018 to be in a mid-to-high 20% range.</p>
