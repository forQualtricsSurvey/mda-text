<p>Comparison of the Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013<br>
 <br>
Revenue:<br>
 <br>
Total revenue increased $7.4 million, or 9%, to $90.1 million during 2014 from $82.7 million in 2013. This increase was due primarily to a $5.2 million increase in service revenue coupled with a $2.2 million increase in revenue from subscriber equipment sales. The primary driver for the increase in service revenue was Duplex service revenue as we continue to see increases in new subscriber activations as a result of equipment sales over the past 12 months and subscribers moving to higher rate plans. Demand for our Duplex products and services increased after we successfully completed the restoration of our second-generation constellation in August 2013 by placing our last second-generation satellite into commercial service. We also experienced increases in our SPOT and Simplex service lines due primarily to growth in both of the related subscriber bases. The increase in equipment sales revenue was due primarily to increased demand for our SPOT products, including the SPOT Gen3 and SPOT Trace. The success of our SPOT products continues to grow as evidenced in part by improving consumer velocity, which is measured by the number of subscriber activations.<br>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>(1)<br>
In 2014 we initiated a process to deactivate certain subscribers in our Duplex subscriber base who were either suspended or non-paying. We deactivated approximately 26,000 subscribers during the first quarter of 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2013, excluding these 26,000 deactivated subscribers from prior period metrics, average subscribers would have been 57,587 and ARPU would have been $32.98. For the year ended December 31, 2014, excluding these 26,000 deactivated subscribers from prior period metrics, average subscribers would have been 62,433 and ARPU would have been $36.03.</p>

<p>(2)<br>
In 2013 we initiated a process to deactivate certain suspended subscribers in our SPOT subscriber base. We deactivated approximately 36,000 subscribers during the first quarter of 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2013, excluding these 36,000 deactivated subscribers from prior period metrics, average subscribers would have been 213,438 and ARPU would have been $10.89.</p>

<p>Gross subscriber additions for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, were approximately 136,000, 108,000 and 115,000, respectively. Because our simplex subscribers are able to activate and deactivate their units several times during the year, we present the Simplex subscriber additions net in these amounts.</p>

<p>The numbers reported in the table above are subject to immaterial rounding inherent in calculating averages.</p>

<p>Other service revenue includes revenue generated from engineering services and third party sources, which is not subscriber driven. Accordingly, we do not present average subscribers or ARPU for other revenue in the above charts.<br>
 <br>
Service Revenue<br>
 <br>
Duplex service revenue increased 18% in 2014 from 2013. During 2014, we continued a process that began in 2012 to convert certain of our Duplex customers to higher rate plans commensurate with our improved service levels. This process resulted in churn among lower rate paying subscribers. As previously stated, we deactivated approximately 26,000 Duplex subscribers from our network in the first quarter of 2014. However, this churn was offset by the transition of subscribers to higher rate plans and the addition of new subscribers in higher rate plans, resulting in increases to service revenue and ARPU. As we completed our second-generation constellation in August 2013, Duplex service levels have improved resulting in an increase in Duplex service revenue as more customers are activating units on our network.</p>

<p>SPOT service revenue increased 4% in 2014 from 2013. Growth in the SPOT subscriber base was driven primarily by new product introductions, including the SPOT Gen3 and SPOT Trace. Ending SPOT subscribers increased 8% from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014.<br>
 <br>
Simplex service revenue increased 10% in 2014 from 2013 due to a 24% increase in average Simplex subscribers during 2014. Throughout 2014, we experienced high demand for our Simplex products, resulting in increased subscriber activations, thus generating additional Simplex service revenue recognized in 2014. Revenue growth for our Simplex customers is not necessarily commensurate with subscriber growth due to the various competitive pricing plans we offer.<br>
 <br>
Other service revenue decreased $0.9 million, or 18%, in 2014 from 2013. This decrease was due primarily to a $0.9 million decrease in our third party revenue. While we were manufacturing and deploying our second-generation constellation, we purchased service from other satellite providers that we re-sold to certain loyal customers. This revenue is recorded in other service revenue as third party revenue. As our coverage is now fully restored, we continue to transition these subscribers to our network, which has contributed to the increase in our Duplex service revenue. As third party revenue decreases, other service revenue will also decrease and high margin Duplex service revenue will increase.<br>
 <br>
Equipment Revenue<br>
 <br>
Revenue from Duplex equipment sales decreased 6% in 2014 as compared to 2013. As a result of launching and placing into service our second-generation satellites, we experienced increased demand for our Duplex two-way voice and data products. However, the decrease in revenue from Duplex equipment sales in 2014 as compared to 2013 resulted from elevated sales of the SPOT Global Phone during 2013. Higher volume sales in 2013 were due to initial trade channel distribution following the product’s release in the second quarter of 2013. This product represented approximately 32% of the total number of phones sold during 2013.</p>

<p>Revenue from SPOT equipment sales increased 38% in 2014 from 2013. Growth in sales of our SPOT products was due to increased demand for SPOT Gen3 and SPOT Trace. The success of our SPOT products continues to grow as evidenced in part by improving consumer velocity, which is measured by the number of subscriber activations.<br>
 <br>
Revenue from Simplex equipment sales increased 11% in 2014 from 2013. We continue to experience demand for our commercial applications for machine-to-machine (&quot;M2M&quot;) asset monitoring and tracking as revenue related to these products increased in 2014 from 2013 due to the mix of products sold during 2014. We included in our 2014 sales the shipment of over 10,000 M2M asset monitoring devices to Ecuador’s commercial fishing fleet.</p>
