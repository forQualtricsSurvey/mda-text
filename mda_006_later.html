<p>(1)Excludes scrap aluminum sales.</p>

<p>Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013</p>

<p>Net sales: Higher shipment volumes, due a full year of ownership of the Sebree smelter which we acquired on June 1, 2013, the acquisition of the Mt. Holly smelter on December 1, 2014 and a shift in product mix from toll to direct sales at Grundartangi, had a $342.5 million positive impact on net sales. Higher price realizations had a positive impact on net sales of $134.2 million. Direct shipments from our four operating smelters increased 242,687 tonnes in 2014 compared to 2013. Toll shipments decreased 140,160 tonnes relative to the same period last year.</p>

<p>Gross profit: During 2014, higher price realizations, net of LME-based power and alumina cost, increased gross profit by $150.7 million, while increased volume, due to the acquisition of the Sebree and Mt. Holly smelters and the mix shift between toll and direct sales at Grundartangi, increased gross profit by $3.9 million. In addition, we experienced $31.4 million in net cost decreases at our smelters relative to 2013, comprised of: lower costs for power and natural gas costs at our U.S. smelters, $45.3 million; other cost increases primarily related to increasing our presence in the value-added business, $9.8 million; and increased depreciation, $4.1 million.</p>

<p>As part of the accounting for the purchase of the Sebree smelter, we recorded a $36.6 million estimated liability for the power contract we assumed based on the difference between the forecasted contract rates and market power rates through the contract termination date in January 2014. This liability was fully amortized over the period from June 1, 2013 through January 31, 2014, resulting in a credit to our depreciation and amortization expense. During 2013, the credit for the amortization of the power contract was $31.0 million. During 2014, the credit for the amortization of the power contract was $5.5 million. This resulted in a year to year decrease in gross profit of $25.5 million.</p>

<p>Due to the nature of our business, our inventory values are subject to fluctuations in market value and these fluctuations may have a significant impact on cost of goods sold and gross profit in any period. On average our inventory turns eight times within a year and reductions in value below cost basis at the end of a period are the new basis for inventory as it turns in subsequent periods.</p>

<p>As of December 31, 2014, the market value of our inventory was above its cost basis requiring no valuation adjustments. As of December 31, 2013, the market value of our inventory was below its cost basis, resulting in the recording of a lower of cost or market (&quot;LCM&quot;) valuation adjustment and a charge to cost of goods sold of $1.2 million for 2013. During 2014, inventory with a $1.2 million market valuation adjustment was consumed into cost of goods sold at the lower basis. The net impact of the 2013 market valuation adjustment on the 2014 and 2013 comparative results is an increase in gross profit of $2.4 million.</p>

<p>Other operating expense – net: Other operating expense - net is primarily related to items associated with Ravenswood. Period to period charges at the facility have been relatively stable, but some post-employment benefits and other support charges are starting to trend downwards. In 2014, we offered a lump sum payout to certain former employees with vested pension benefits in an effort to reduce our long-term pension liabilities. As a result, we recorded a settlement charge of $4.7 million to other operating expense-net.</p>

<p>Selling, general and administrative expenses: During 2014, we experienced decreased selling, general and administrative charges due to a reduction in external legal and outside professional service support and the absence of the relocation and severance expenses we incurred in 2013 to move our corporate headquarters to Chicago. In 2014, we incurred additional charges of $2.6 million related to the separation of former senior executives. We recorded a charge of $8.4 million in 2013 related to the separation of our former chief executive officer. Also, we incurred $8.6 million of general and administrative expenses in 2013 that relate to the integration of the Century Vlissingen anode facility into our business. The Century Vlissingen anode facility is now producing anodes and its costs are included in cost of goods sold in 2014.</p>

<p>Net gain (loss) on forward and derivative contracts: The net gain on forward and derivative contracts in 2013 was primarily the result of an increase in the fair value of a derivative asset embedded in the E.ON contingent liability. This change in fair value resulted in unrealized gains of $16.4 million in 2013. We have recorded unrealized gains of $1.4 million in 2014 related to the derivative asset embedded in the E.ON contingent liability.</p>

<p>Gain on bargain purchase: On June 1, 2013, we acquired the Sebree smelter. The allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on the estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Based on the final purchase price allocation, we recorded a gain on bargain purchase of $5.3 million in 2013. See Note 2 Business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information.</p>

<p>Gain on fair value of contingent consideration:  On December 1, 2014, we acquired Alcoa’s 50.3% stake in Mt. Holly for $67.5 million in cash less certain amounts owed by Alumax to the Mt. Holly operating partnership and for certain post-employment retiree medical obligations. The acquisition is also subject to adjustments for working capital and a true-up process intended to place the parties in approximately the same economic position as if the acquisition had closed on September 30, 2014. The purchase agreement includes a potential payment that will be based on the Midwest Transaction Price and production levels at Mt. Holly. The maximum amount of this post-closing cash payment by Century to Alcoa is $22.5 million and by Alcoa to Century is $12.5 million. The measurement period for this potential payment ends on December 31, 2015. At December 1, 2014, we estimated that we would make a payment to Alcoa of $13.8 million and recorded a liability of $13.8 million as contingent consideration on the opening balance sheet. Due to movements in aluminum market prices during December, the fair value of the contingent consideration was reduced by $7.9 million, resulting in a $7.9 million gain. See Note 2 Business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information.</p>

<p>Gain on remeasurement of equity investment: We accounted for the acquisition of Alcoa’s 50.3% stake in Mt. Holly as a step acquisition which required that we remeasure our existing 49.7% ownership interest (previously accounted for as an equity method investment) to fair value. The fair value of our interest in Mt. Holly was $56.7 million at closing, resulting in a non-cash pre-tax gain of $1.3 million in 2014. See Note 2 Business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information.</p>

<p>Loss on early extinguishment of debt: In 2013, as a result of the tender offer and redemption of our 8% senior secured notes due 2014 (the &quot;8.0% Notes&quot;), we recorded charges of $3.3 million for loss on early extinguishment of debt. We determined the tender and redemption of the 8.0% Notes should be treated as an extinguishment of the debt and accordingly, we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt in the second quarter of 2013. The loss on early extinguishment of debt consisted of the write-off of deferred financing costs and the debt discount associated with the 8.0% Notes, as well as the tender premium paid as part of the tender offer and redemption of the 8.0% Notes.</p>

<p>Income tax expense: We have a valuation allowance against all of our U.S. and certain foreign deferred tax assets. The significant driver of period to period differences in income tax expense is the change in earnings at our foreign entities that are not subject to a valuation allowance. See Note 14 Income taxes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information.</p>
