<p>We produce primary aluminum. The aluminum industry is cyclical and the price of primary aluminum (which trades as a commodity) is determined by global supply and demand, among other factors. The key determinants of our results of operations and cash flow from operations are as follows:</p>

<p>•Our selling price is based on the LME price of primary aluminum and is influenced by regional delivery premiums and, at certain times, by fixed price sales contracts. In addition, we receive product premiums on certain value-added products (including high-purity aluminum and billet products).</p>

<p>•In normal circumstances, our facilities operate at or near capacity, and fluctuations in volume, other than through curtailments, acquisitions or expansion, generally are small.</p>

<p>•The principal components of cost of goods sold are electrical power, alumina, carbon products and labor, which in aggregate exceed 75% of our cost of goods sold. Many of these costs are governed by long-term contracts.</p>

<p>The production of primary aluminum requires capital-intensive facilities and consumes large amounts of electrical power. The continuous production cycle of primary aluminum and the high costs associated with restarting operations after a prolonged interruption or curtailment limit our ability to scale our production to current economic conditions.</p>

<p>Shipment volumes, average realized price and cost of goods sold per tonne shipped are our key performance indicators. Revenue can vary significantly from period to period due to the fluctuations in the LME and regional delivery premiums. Any adverse changes in the conditions that affect shipment volumes or the market price of primary aluminum could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Fluctuations in working capital are influenced by shipments, the LME and regional delivery and value-added premiums, cost of electrical power, raw materials and operating supplies, and by the timing of cash receipts from major customers and disbursements to our suppliers.</p>

<p>Our operating results vary significantly with changes in the price of primary aluminum and the materials used in its production, including electrical power, alumina, aluminum fluoride and carbon products. Because we sell our products based principally on the LME price for primary aluminum and regional delivery premiums, we cannot pass on increased costs to our customers. Although we attempt to mitigate the effects of price fluctuations from time to time through the use of various fixed-price commitments, financial instruments and also by pricing some of our raw materials and electrical power contracts based on LME prices, these efforts also limit our ability to take advantage of favorable changes in the market prices for primary aluminum or raw materials and may affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.</p>
