<p>Accounting for Investment in National CineMedia, LLC and Related Agreements</p>

<p>We have an investment in NCM. NCM operates a digital in-theatre network in the U.S. for providing cinema advertising and non-film events. Upon joining NCM, the Company and NCM entered into an Exhibitor Services Agreement (“ESA”), pursuant to which NCM provides advertising, promotion and event services to the Company’s theatres. On February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc., or NCM Inc., a newly formed entity that serves as a member and the sole manager of NCM, completed an initial public offering of its common stock. In connection with the NCM Inc. initial public offering, the Company amended its operating agreement and the Exhibitor Services Agreement, or ESA, with NCM and received proceeds related to the modification of the ESA and the Company’s sale of certain of its shares in NCM. The ESA modification reflected a shift from circuit share expense under the prior Exhibitor Services Agreement, which obligated NCM to pay the Company a percentage of revenue, to a monthly theatre access fee, which significantly reduced the contractual amounts paid to the Company by NCM. The Company recorded the proceeds related to the ESA modification as deferred revenue, which is being amortized into other revenues over the life of the agreement using the units of revenue method. As a result of the proceeds received as part of the NCM, Inc. initial public offering, the Company had a negative basis in its original membership units in NCM (referred to herein as its Tranche 1 Investment). The Company does not recognize undistributed equity in the earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment until NCM&#x27;s future net earnings, less distributions received, surpass the amount of the excess distribution. The Company recognizes equity in earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment only to the extent it receives cash distributions from NCM. The Company believes that the accounting model provided by ASC 323-10-35-22 for recognition of equity investee losses in excess of an investor&#x27;s basis is analogous to the accounting for equity income subsequent to recognizing an excess distribution.</p>

<p>Pursuant to a Common Unit Adjustment Agreement dated as of February 13, 2007 between NCM, Inc. and Cinemark, AMC and Regal, collectively referred to as its Founding Members, annual adjustments to the common membership units are made primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each Founding Member.  To account for the receipt of additional common units under the Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, the Company follows the guidance in ASC 323-10-35-29 (formerly EITF 02-18, Accounting for Subsequent Investments in an Investee after Suspension of Equity Loss Recognition) by analogy, which also refers to AICPA Technical Practice Aid 2220.14, which indicates that if a subsequent investment is made in an equity method investee that has experienced significant losses, the investor must determine if the subsequent investment constitutes funding of prior losses.  The Company concluded that the construction or acquisition of new theatres that has led to the common unit adjustments equates to making additional investments in National CineMedia. The Company evaluated the receipt of the additional common units in National CineMedia and the assets exchanged for these additional units and has determined that the right to use its incremental new screens would not be considered funding of prior losses. The Company accounts for these additional common units (referred to herein as its Tranche 2 Investment) as a separate investment than its Tranche 1 Investment.  The common units received are recorded at fair value as an increase in the Company’s investment in NCM with an offset to deferred revenue.  The deferred revenue is amortized over the remaining term of the ESA.  The Tranche 2 Investment is accounted for following the equity method, with undistributed equity earnings related to its Tranche 2 Investment included as a component of equity in income of affiliates and distributions received related to its Tranche 2 Investment are recorded as a reduction of its investment basis. See “Impact of Recent Accounting Developments” below.</p>

<p>Impact of Recent Accounting Developments</p>

<p>Impact of New Revenue Recognition Standard</p>

<p>In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), (“ASC 606”), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASC 606 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles when it becomes effective. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the contracts with customers.</p>

<p>ASC 606 permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (modified retrospective method).</p>

<p>We adopted ASC 606 as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. The new standard will therefore be applied to all contracts not completed as of January 1, 2018.  While we do not believe the adoption of ASC 606 will have a material impact to our results of operations or cash flows, we do expect ASC 606 to have an impact on the classification of certain revenues and related expenses, as summarized below.  Quantitative amounts included below are estimates of the expected effects of our adoption of ASC 606 and represent management’s best estimates of the impact of adopting ASC 606 at the time of the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The actual impact of ASC 606 is subject to change from these estimates, pending the completion of our assessment during the first quarter of 2018.  <br>

We believe our Exhibitor’s Services Agreement (“ESA”) with National CineMedia, LLC (“NCM”) includes a significant financing component due to the length of time necessary to fulfill the performance obligations under the ESA as compared to the timing of receipt of the advanced payment. Similarly, we believe our Common Unit Adjustment (“CUA”) Agreement with NCM includes a significant financing component due to the receipt of common units in advance of the fulfillment of the performance obligations.  As a result, we expect other revenues, specifically screen advertising revenues, will increase with a similar offsetting increase in noncash interest expense, but will not have a material impact on our results of operations.</p>

<p>•<br>
In addition to recording the impact of significant financing components associated with our NCM ESA and CUA agreement, we have determined that based on how the performance obligations are fulfilled under these agreements, the related deferred revenues will be amortized on a straight-line basis under ASC 606 versus the units of revenue method followed prior to adoption of ASC 606.  As a result of the change in amortization method, we expect to record a cumulative effect of accounting change adjustment of no more than $55 million in retained earnings effective January 1, 2018, with an offsetting decrease in deferred revenue - NCM.  <br>
 <br>
•<br>
We currently record online surcharges net of service fees as amounts have been immaterial. We have determined that we are the principal in the arrangement, and therefore, in accordance with ASC 606 guidance, we will recognize online surcharges in revenues on a gross basis and record all related service fees as an operating expense.  As a result of this change, our other revenues and utilities and other costs will increase on a prospective basis, but will not have a material impact on our results of operations.  <br>
 <br>
•<br>
We currently have a domestic loyalty program that awards points to our members upon completion of various purchases and other transactions. Under ASC 606, we will have to defer a portion of the proceeds received from each purchase as a liability to provide future goods and services (or rewards in exchange for points) to program members.  We expect this will result in slight reductions in admissions and concessions revenues with an offsetting increase in other long-term liabilities, but will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.</p>

<p>The timing of revenue recognition for other revenue streams, including revenues for unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sales-type certificates, will also be impacted by the adoption of ASC 606, but we do not expect such changes to be material.</p>

<p>Impact of Tax Reform</p>

<p>On December 22, 2017, the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act, among other things, lowered the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 and included a one-time transition tax on certain undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. We recorded a net one-time benefit of $44.9 million, all non-cash, related to enactment of the Tax Act, including a re-measurement of deferred tax liabilities using the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate, a reassessment of permanently reinvested earnings, a deemed repatriation tax, and a reduction in a deferred tax asset with regard to foreign tax credit carryforwards.</p>

<p>While we have substantially completed our provisional analysis of the income tax effects of the Tax Act and recorded a reasonable estimate of such effects, the net one-time charge related to the Tax Act may differ, possibly materially, due to: further refinement of our calculations, changes in interpretations and assumptions that we have made, and additional guidance that may be issued by the U.S. government. We will complete our analysis over a one-year measurement period ending December 22, 2018, and any adjustments during this measurement period will be included in net income from continuing operations as an adjustment to income tax expense in the reporting period when such adjustments are determined.</p>
