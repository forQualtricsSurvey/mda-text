<p>Impairment of Long-Lived Assets</p>

<p>We review long-lived assets for impairment indicators on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. We assess many factors including the following to determine whether to impair individual theatre assets:<br>
 <br>
 	•	 	<br>
actual theatre level cash flows;</p>

<p>•	 	<br>
budgeted theatre level cash flows;</p>

<p>•	 	<br>
theatre property and equipment carrying values;</p>

<p>•	 	<br>
amortizing intangible asset carrying values;</p>

<p>•	 	<br>
the age of a recently built theatre;</p>

<p>•	 	<br>
competitive theatres in the marketplace;</p>

<p>•	 	<br>
the impact of recent ticket price changes;</p>

<p>•	 	<br>
the impact of recent theatre remodels or other substantial improvements;</p>

<p>•	 	<br>
available lease renewal options; and</p>

<p>•	 	<br>
other factors considered relevant in our assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets.</p>

<p>Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which we believe is the lowest applicable level for which there are identifiable cash flows. The impairment evaluation is based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows from continuing use through the remainder of the theatre’s useful life. The remainder of the theatre’s useful life correlates with the available remaining lease period, which includes the probability of renewal periods for leased properties and the lesser of twenty years or the building’s remaining useful life for fee owned properties. If the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover a long-lived asset’s carrying value, we then compare the carrying value of the asset group (theatre) with its estimated fair value. When estimated fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value of the asset group (theatre), the asset group (theatre) is written down to its estimated fair value. Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value. Management’s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples. Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was six and a half times for the evaluations performed during 2014, 2015 and 2016. The long-lived asset impairment charges related to theatre properties recorded during each of the periods presented are specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics, or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.</p>
