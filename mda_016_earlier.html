<p>Liquidity and Capital Resources<br>
 <br>
At December 31, 2013 our aggregate cash and short-term investments totaled $19.1 million.  During the first quarter of 2013 we completed the sale of certain Peruvian exploration properties to a third party for net proceeds of $3.5 million. We received other proceeds of $0.5 million related to joint venture option payments on other Mexican and Peruvian exploration properties. With the cash balance at December 31, 2013, and the assumptions described below, and excluding costs related to a potential restart of the Velardeña Properties, we expect to have sufficient funding to continue our long term business strategy through 2014, ending 2014 with a cash balance of approximately $5.0 million. Absent a source of cash flow beyond 2014, our cash balance would be depleted by midyear 2015.  In addition, a potential restart of the Velardeña Properties during 2014 could require additional funding.  We will be required to seek additional funding from equity or debt or from monetization of non-core assets.  There can be no assurance that we would be successful in obtaining sufficient funding from any of these actions or sources in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all.<br>
 <br>
Our cash and short-term investment balance at December 31, 2013 of $19.1 million is $25.5 million lower than the $44.6 million in similar assets held at December 31, 2012 due primarily to $6.9 million in operating losses at the Velardeña Properties; $6.4 million related to Velardeña shutdown and care and maintenance costs; $4.8 million in Velardeña Properties capital and development expenditures; $4.6 million in exploration expenditures; $5.6 million in general and administrative expenses; and $2.6 million spent on the El Quevar project; offset in part by net proceeds of $4.0 million from the sale of non strategic exploration property interests and a decrease in working capital of $1.4 million primarily related to a reduction in inventories and receivables at the Velardeña Properties.<br>
 <br>
With the cash balance at December 31, 2013 of $19.1 million we plan to spend the following amounts totaling approximately $14.0 million during 2014.  These amounts do not include costs related to a potential restart of the Velardeña Properties.<br>
 <br>
·                  Approximately $3.5 million on care and maintenance activities at the Velardeña Properties, primarily related to labor and contractor costs;<br>
 <br>
·                  Approximately $1.0 million on drilling costs at the Velardeña Properties related to the development of restart plans;</p>

<p>·                  Approximately $1.0 million at the El Quevar project to fund ongoing maintenance activities and property holding costs;<br>
 <br>
·                  Approximately $3.5 million on other exploration activities and property holding costs related to the Company’s portfolio of exploration properties located primarily in Mexico; and<br>
 <br>
·                  Approximately $5.5 million on general and administrative costs partially offset by $0.5 million in decreased working capital, primarily related to the collection of VAT receivables.<br>
 <br>
The actual amount that we spend through year-end 2014 and the projected year-end cash balance may vary significantly from the amounts specified above and will depend on a number of factors, including the timing and costs associated with a potential restart of the Velardeña Properties, and the results of continued project assessment work at our other exploration properties. If we are able to restart mining at the Velardeña Properties on a profitable basis, it is unlikely that those activities will generate sufficient revenue to fund all of our continuing business activities as currently conducted. We will be required to seek additional funding from equity or debt or from monetization of non-core assets. Therefore, whether or not we recommence mining at the Velardeña Properties, we expect to require additional funding in 2014 or 2015 for general and administrative costs and other working capital needs to fund our continuing business activities.</p>
