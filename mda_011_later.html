<p>Critical Accounting Estimates</p>

<p>Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 Summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements. The preparation of the financial statements requires that management make judgments, assumptions and estimates in applying these accounting policies. Those judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience about past and current events and on assumptions about future events. Critical accounting estimates require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and a change in these estimates may have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Significant judgments and estimates made by our management include expenses and liabilities related to pensions and other postretirement benefits (&quot;OPEB&quot;), deferred tax assets, accounting for business combinations and property, plant and equipment. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure.</p>

<p>Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Liabilities</p>

<p>We sponsor several pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Our liabilities under these defined benefit plans are determined using methodologies that involve several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, health care cost inflation rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets.</p>

<p>Discount Rate Selection</p>

<p>It is our policy to select a discount rate for purposes of measuring obligations under defined benefit plans by matching cash flows separately for each plan to yields on high-quality zero coupon bonds. We use the Ryan Discount Rate Curve (the &quot;Ryan Curve&quot;) which is considered acceptable under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (&quot;GAAP&quot;). We believe the Ryan Curve provides a method of developing spot curve yield (our discount rate) that is consistent with observable market conditions.</p>

<p>The Ryan Curve was specifically developed to meet the criteria set forth in ASC 715 &quot;Compensation — Retirement Benefits.&quot; The published information at the end of each calendar month includes spot rate yields (high quality zero coupon bond yield estimates) in half year increments for use in tailoring a discount rate to a particular plan&#x27;s projected benefit cash flows. The Ryan Curve rate represents the assumed discount rate developed from these spot rate yields, based on the pattern and duration of the benefit payments of a typical, large, somewhat mature pension plan (that we believe is consistent with our plans).</p>

<p>The individual characteristics of each plan, including projected cash flow patterns and payment durations, have been taken into account, since discount rates are determined on a plan-by-plan basis. We will generally select a discount rate rounded to the nearest 0.25%, unless specific circumstances provide for a more appropriate non-rounded rate to be used. We believe the projected cash flows used to determine the Ryan Curve rate provide a good approximation of the timing and amounts of our defined benefit payments under our plans and no adjustment to the Ryan Curve rate has been made.</p>

<p>A change of a half percentage point in the discount rate for our defined benefit plans would have the following effects on our obligations under these plans as of December 31, 2014:</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>Century provides postretirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for a portion of the retired employees of our U.S. based operations. ASC 715 requires the accrual of the estimated cost of providing postretirement benefits during the working careers of those employees who could become eligible for such benefits when they retire. We fund these benefits as the retirees submit claims.</p>

<p>Measurement of our postretirement benefit obligations requires the use of several assumptions about factors that will affect the amount and timing of future benefit payments. The assumed health care cost trend rates are the most critical estimates for measurement of the postretirement benefit obligation. Changes in the health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care benefit obligation.</p>

<p>Medical cost inflation is initially estimated to be 8%, declining to 5% over seven years and thereafter. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care benefit obligations. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have had the following effects in 2014:</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>Long-term Rate of Return on Plan assets assumption</p>

<p>We are currently using a 7.25% long-term rate of return on plan assets for the development of the net periodic cost for the defined benefit pension plans. The rate was selected by taking into account our expected asset mix and is based on historical performance as well as expected future rates of return on plan assets.</p>

<p>Deferred Income Tax Assets</p>

<p>We regularly assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established. When a valuation allowance is established or increased, an income tax charge is included in the consolidated statement of operations and net deferred tax assets are adjusted accordingly. Changes in tax laws, statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels could result in actual realization of the deferred tax assets being materially different from the amounts provided for in the consolidated financial statements. If the actual recovery amount of the deferred tax asset is less than anticipated, we would be required to write-off the remaining deferred tax asset and increase the tax provision.</p>

<p>The amount of a valuation allowance is based upon our best estimate of our ability to realize the net deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance can subsequently be reversed when we believe that the assets are realizable on a more likely than not basis. We have a valuation allowance of $748 million against all of our U.S. and Netherlands deferred tax assets and a portion of our Icelandic deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2014, due to our assessment that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized based on our cumulative net losses.</p>

<p>Accounting for Business Combinations</p>

<p>We account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of the acquisition at their respective estimated fair values. The judgments used to estimate the fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as the estimated life of each, can materially impact the results of operations for the current period and for periods subsequent to the acquisition through depreciation and amortization. For significant acquisitions, the purchase price allocation is carried out with assistance from independent third-party valuation specialists.</p>

<p>Mt. Holly Acquisition</p>

<p>On December 1, 2014, we completed the acquisition of Alcoa’s 50.3% stake in Mt. Holly for a purchase price of $67.5 million in cash subject to working capital and other similar adjustments.</p>

<p>Contingent consideration</p>

<p>The acquisition agreement provides for a post-closing cash payment, either by Century to Alcoa, or by Alcoa to Century, to be made following December 31, 2015 based on (i) changes in the Midwest Transaction Price for aluminum between July 2, 2014 and December 31, 2015 and (ii) the aggregate cast house production of Mt. Holly from October 1, 2014 through December 31, 2015. The maximum amount of this post-closing cash payment by (i) Century to Alcoa is $22,500 and (ii) Alcoa to Century is $12,500. Determining the fair value of the post-closing cash payment requires management to estimate the expected cast house production through December 31, 2015, and estimate the expected average Midwest Transaction Price during the remaining period through December 31, 2015. Our cast house production estimates are based on our business plan for the period covered. We estimated the Midwest Transaction Price using the LME forward curve and historical and estimated Midwest Premiums. There are no publicly published forward curves or future quotes for the Midwest Premium. We used estimates of the Midwest Premium that are consistent with our business planning activities. Changes in the estimates and assumptions we used could result in a materially different valuation of these assumed liabilities and their amortization, which could have had a material effect on our results of operations.</p>

<p>Sebree</p>

<p>As part of the Sebree acquisition, we assumed an unfavorable electrical power supply agreement with a fair value of approximately $36.6 million and recorded the liability on Sebree’s opening balance sheet. Determining the fair value of the assumed liability required us to make estimates of future prices under the existing electrical power supply agreement as well as estimates of future MISO prices plus transmission and other costs. In 2013, we recognized income of approximately $31.0 million related to the amortization of this unfavorable electrical power supply agreement liability. Changes in the estimates and assumptions we used could result in a materially different valuation of these assumed liabilities and their amortization, which could have had a material effect on our results of operations.</p>

<p>Property, Plant and Equipment Impairment</p>

<p>We review our property, plant and equipment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets (asset group) may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of the assets (asset group) is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets (asset group). In that case, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets (asset group), with the fair value determined using a discounted cash flow calculation. These estimates of future cash flows include management’s assumptions about the expected use of the assets (asset group), the remaining useful life, expenditures to maintain the service potential, market and cost assumptions.</p>

<p>Determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves significant management judgment involving highly uncertain matters, including estimating the future sales volumes, future selling prices and costs, alternative uses for the asset, and estimated proceeds from the disposal of the asset. However, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on estimates and assumptions that take into account our business plans and long-term investment decisions at the time of such impairment reviews.</p>

<p>We are currently evaluating the Helguvik project’s cost, scope and schedule, in light of issues surrounding the Helguvik electrical power agreements. These agreements contain certain conditions to the power suppliers&#x27; obligations and the power suppliers have alleged that certain of these conditions have not been satisfied. In July 2014, HS, one of our power suppliers, commenced arbitration proceedings against Nordural Helguvik ehf seeking, among other things, an order declaring, (i) that the conditions to the power contract have not been fulfilled and, (ii) that the power contract is therefore no longer valid. We are currently in negotiations with both power suppliers with respect to such conditions and other matters pertaining to these agreements. If we are unable to reach agreement regarding the satisfaction of the remaining conditions to the power agreements, we may have to seek alternative sources of power, incur substantially increased power costs or further curtail construction activities of the Helguvik project. Due to the limited number of Icelandic power providers with resources sufficient to provide power to the Helguvik project (only three are currently in operation in Iceland), we may find it difficult or impossible to procure additional sources of power if these suppliers do not perform under their existing agreements and may be unable to complete construction of the smelter. If we agree to pay increased prices for power or substantially delay or are unable to complete the Helguvik project, we may have to recognize a substantial loss on our investment.</p>

<p>The aggregate capital expenditures through December 31, 2014 related to the Helguvik project were approximately $148 million. In evaluating the construction in progress at Helguvik, if we believe there are indicators of impairment, we would consider the costs to complete the construction and the estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the estimated useful life of Helguvik and compare the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value and expected costs to complete construction of the Helguvik project to determine if an impairment exists. If we do not restart construction, we may have to recognize a loss on our investment at the time that a decision is made to abandon the project.</p>

<p>In February 2009, we curtailed the operations of the Ravenswood facility. The net carrying value of the asset group at the Ravenswood facility was approximately $46 million at December 31, 2014. If the estimated future undiscounted cash flows from the asset group were less than the carrying value of the asset group or our assumptions for the use of this facility were to change, we would recognize a loss on all or a portion of the assets at that time. The estimated future undiscounted cash flows assume that the operations at the Ravenswood facility will resume once adequate LME prices for primary aluminum are reached and upon the successful negotiation and execution of certain critical enabling agreements for power and labor. If we believed that there are indicators of an impairment, we would compare the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of Ravenswood and the expected cost of restarting the facility to determine if an impairment exists.</p>
