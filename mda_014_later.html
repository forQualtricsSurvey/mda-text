<p>2014 Highlights<br>
 <br>
We recommenced mining activities at the Velardeña Properties in July 2014 and began processing material from the mine in November 2014. Our decision to restart mining activities followed an extensive evaluation period, which began after the shutdown of the Velardeña Properties in June 2013 and included a 9,000-meter drill program that concluded in June 2014. In addition to the Velardeña Properties, we are focused on establishing a second group of mining assets, which may include those recently acquired assets in the Parral District in Chihuahua Mexico. During 2014 we continued our exploration efforts on selected properties in our portfolio of approximately 30 exploration properties located primarily in Mexico. We continued to hold our El Quevar property on care and maintenance until we can find a partner to further advance the project. We reduced general and administrative expenses in 2014 by approximately 17% over 2013 expenses. We also continued to review strategic opportunities, focusing on development or operating properties in North America, including Mexico.<br>
 <br>
Financing Activities<br>
 <br>
·                  On September 10, 2014, the Company completed an underwritten registered public offering and concurrent private placement for total net proceeds, after underwriter commissions and expenses, of $7.4 million. The Company sold 3,692,000 units in the registered offering, priced at $0.86 per unit, before discount to the underwriters, with each unit consisting of one share of the Company’s common stock and a five year warrant to purchase 0.50 of a share of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $1.21 per share. The Company sold an additional 5,800,000 units in a concurrent private placement to The Sentient Group (“Sentient”), the Company’s largest stockholder, at a price of $0.817 per unit, the same discounted price paid by the underwriter in the registered offering. Following the completion of the Private Placement and the Offering, Sentient holds approximately 27.2% (on a non-diluted basis) of the Company’s outstanding common stock (excluding restricted common stock held by the Company’s employees).<br>
 <br>
Sale of Assets<br>
 <br>
·                  We generated approximately $1.0 million in asset sales in 2014, including $700,000 from the sale of mining concessions totaling 770 hectares located in the Zacatecas District in Mexico, $150,000 as partial payment for the sale of our 1,100 hectare Peruvian Otuzco property, and $130,000 from the sale of miscellaneous surplus equipment located in Argentina.<br>
 <br>
Restart of Mining at the Velardeña Properties<br>
 <br>
·                  Following the shutdown of the Velardeña Properties in June 2013, we continued to develop and evaluate plans to restart mining. We completed this evaluation and new mine plans in the second quarter 2014. In July 2014 we restarted mining at the Velardeña Properties and began processing material from the mine in November 2014. During 2014 we generated payable metals totaling approximately 42,000 silver equivalent ounces (equivalents calculated at 70:1 silver to gold) and included approximately 29,000 ounces of silver and 194 ounces of gold. In 2015 we expect output of approximately 0.8 to 1.0 million silver equivalent ounces (including silver and gold but excluding lead and zinc and calculated at a ratio of 70 silver ounces to 1 gold ounce), with cash costs in 2015 between $12.00 and $15.00 per payable silver ounce net of by-product gold, lead and zinc credits, assuming a price for gold of $1,250 per ounce. “Cash costs per payable silver ounce, net of by-product credits” is a non-GAAP financial measure defined below in “—Non-GAAP Financial Measures”.<br>
 <br>
·                  Under our new mine plan, we are using shrinkage stope mining, standard mechanized cut and fill and an overhand cut and fill mining method and slusher mucking in the stopes in the narrower veins. This later mining method should allow us to mine narrower vein widths with a significant decrease in dilution, which should allow higher grade material to be hauled to the mill. Since reopening Velardeña, we have employed about half of the employees prior to the June 2013 shutdown when we were running both sulfide and oxide plants and processing approximately 500 tonnes per day (“tpd”). In 2014 we processed mined material to make silver and gold bearing lead and zinc concentrates, and in 2015 we expect to also make saleable pyrite concentrates. During 2014 and 2015 we are focused primarily on mining on the San Mateo, Terneras and Roca Negra veins, which contain higher grade material over more consistent widths in the 0.5 to 1.0 meter range, with significantly lower arsenic levels than those in the Santa Juana vein system that was the focus of our previous mining activity.<br>
 <br>
·                  We began processing material through the sulfide mill in November 2014. During November 2014 we tested new equipment in the mill including a revamped electrical system, concentrate filters for our concentrate products, refurbished flotation cells and other equipment. Grades were low in November 2014 as we processed material from stope access drifts and raises to test plant circuits that were refurbished as part of the restart. Average grades in November were 109 grams per tonne silver and 1.3 grams per tonne gold, with payable metals generated from the processing facilities of approximately 12,000 silver equivalent ounces, which is exclusive of process inventory buildup in the circuit.  In December 2014 the mill began operating at nearly full capacity of an average 264 tpd. We are continuing to ramp up to the 285 tpd rate, which we expect to achieve late in the first quarter 2015. Average grades in December had increased to 127 grams per tonne silver and 1.8 grams per tonne gold, with payable metals generated from the processing facilities of approximately 31,000 silver equivalent ounces. We expect feed material grades to gradually increase through the second quarter of 2015 as new stopes in the mine are developed and access to the Terneras vein increases. We also continue to actively search for oxide feed from outside sources, which could enable us to restart the oxide plant.<br>
 <br>
El Quevar<br>
 <br>
·                  We continue to hold our El Quevar property on care and maintenance and to reduce holding costs until we can find a partner to fund further exploration.</p>

<p>Exploration<br>
 <br>
·                  In the first quarter 2014, we completed a 2,000 meter drill program at the 233 hectare Los Azules property in Chihuahua, Mexico. Based on results from this phase one drilling program, we conducted a phase two drill program and have completed in both programs a total of 7,475 meters in 30 holes drilled from both surface and underground. Based on these drill results and underground sampling, we believe we have identified a silver and gold deposit and expect to issue a report regarding the results of these programs in the first quarter 2015.<br>
 <br>
·                  In August 2014, we entered into an agreement giving us the right to acquire for $1.6 million the Santa Maria mine, a privately held property near the Parral District of southern Chihuahua State, Mexico, located approximately 20 kilometers from the Los Azules project. We have completed an initial drill program of 11 holes totaling 2,300 meters at Santa Maria and identified a silver and gold deposit. We expect to issue a report on the results in the first quarter 2015.</p>
