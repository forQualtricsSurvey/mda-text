<p>Investing Activities</p>

<p>Our investing activities have been principally related to the development, remodel and acquisition of theatres. New theatre openings and acquisitions historically have been financed with internally generated cash and by debt financing, including borrowings under our senior secured credit facility. Cash used for investing activities amounted to $253.3 million, $328.1 million and $327.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. The increases in cash used for investing activities during 2015 and 2016 is primarily due to increased capital expenditures.</p>

<p>Capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 were as follows (in millions):</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>(a) 	<br>
The amount for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes approximately $26.3 million for the purchase of our corporate headquarters building in Plano, TX.</p>

<p>Capital expenditures for existing theatres in the table above includes the costs of remodeling certain of our existing properties to include Luxury Loungers and expanded concession offerings, which began during 2015. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, we had an average of 33 and 89 of our domestic screens, respectively, temporarily closed for such remodels.</p>

<p>Our U.S. theatre circuit consisted of 339 theatres with 4,559 screens as of December 31, 2016. We built six new theatres and 69 screens, acquired four theatres with 52 screens and closed eight theatres with 80 screens during the year ended December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, we had signed commitments to open three new theatres and 30 screens in domestic markets during 2017 and open six new theatres with 71 screens subsequent to 2017. We estimate the remaining capital expenditures for the development of these 101 domestic screens will be approximately $61 million.</p>

<p>Our international theatre circuit consisted of 187 theatres with 1,344 screens as of December 31, 2016. We built twelve new theatres and 75 screens and closed one theatre with nine screens during the year ended December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, we had signed commitments to open five new theatres and 39 screens in international markets during 2017 and open one theatre and five screens subsequent to 2017. We estimate the remaining capital expenditures for the development of these 44 international screens will be approximately $18 million.</p>

<p>Actual expenditures for continued theatre development, remodels and acquisitions are subject to change based upon the availability of attractive opportunities. We plan to fund capital expenditures for our continued development with cash flow from operations, borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, and proceeds from debt issuances, sale leaseback transactions and/or sales of excess real estate.</p>
