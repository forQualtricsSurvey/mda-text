<p>Cash Position and Indebtedness<br>
 <br>
As of December 31, 2014, we held cash and cash equivalents of $7.1 million, and $24.0 million was available under the equity line agreement with Terrapin. Additionally, we have approximately $37.9 million in restricted cash which must be maintained through the term of the Facility Agreement and may be used to pay principal and interest under the Facility Agreement.</p>

<p>As of December 31, 2013, we held cash and cash equivalents of $17.4 million, and $24.0 million was available under the equity line agreement with Terrapin. We also had funds available under the Consent Agreement and the Common Stock Purchase and Option Agreement. Thermo’s remaining commitment under the Consent Agreement was $5.0 million.<br>
 <br>
The carrying amount of our current and long-term debt outstanding was $6.5 million and $623.6 million, respectively, at December 31, 2014, compared to $4.0 million and $665.2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2013. The $41.6 million decrease in our long-term debt balance from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014 is due primarily to the conversion of our remaining 8.00% Notes Issued in 2009 on April 15, 2014 following the automatic conversion of these notes. These conversions reduced the carrying value of our debt by approximately $33.8 million. Additionally, conversions of our 8% Notes Issued in 2013 reduced the carrying value of our outstanding debt by approximately $11.5 million. Offsetting these decreases was an increase in the carrying value of the Thermo Loan Agreement due to interest accruing on that debt. The current portion of long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2014 represents the principal payments due during 2015 under our Facility Agreement.</p>
