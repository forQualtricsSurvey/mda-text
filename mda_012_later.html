<p>Other Contingencies</p>

<p>We are a defendant in several actions relating to various aspects of our business. While it is impossible to predict the ultimate disposition of any litigation, we do not believe that any of these lawsuits, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. See Note 15 Commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information.</p>

<p>Recently Issued Accounting Standards Updates</p>

<p>Information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 Summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included herein.</p>

<p>Contractual Obligations</p>

<p>In the normal course of business, we have entered into various contractual obligations that will be settled in cash. These obligations consist primarily of long-term debt obligations and purchase obligations. The expected future cash flows required to meet these obligations are shown in the table below. More information is available about these contractual obligations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein.</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>(1)Long-term debt includes principal repayments on the 7.5% Notes due 2021 and the IRBs. Payments are based on the assumption that all outstanding debt instruments will remain outstanding until their respective due dates. Based on the LME forward market prices for primary aluminum at December 31, 2014 and management&#x27;s estimate of the LME forward market for periods beyond the quoted periods, we have assessed that we will not have any payment obligations for the E.ON contingent obligation through the term of the agreement, which expires in 2028.</p>

<p>(2)Estimated interest payments on our long-term debt are based on several assumptions, including an assumption that all outstanding debt instruments will remain outstanding until their respective due dates. Our estimated future interest payments for any debt with a variable rate are based on the assumption that the December 31, 2014 rate for that debt continues until the respective due date. We assume that no interest payments on the E.ON contingent obligation will be paid through the term of agreement, see above.</p>

<p>(3)Purchase obligations include long-term alumina, power contracts and anode contracts, excluding market-based power and raw material requirements contracts. For contracts with LME-based pricing provisions, including our long-term alumina contracts and Icelandic power contracts, we assumed a LME price using the LME forward curve as of December 31, 2014.</p>

<p>(4)Includes the undiscounted estimated benefit payments for our OPEB obligations, which are unfunded.</p>

<p>(5)Other liabilities include estimated SERB benefit payments, workers&#x27; compensation benefit payments and asset retirement obligations. Asset retirement obligations are estimated disposal costs for the potliner currently in service.</p>
