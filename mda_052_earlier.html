<p>Facility Agreement<br>
 <br>
Our senior secured credit facility agreement was amended and restated effective in August 2013 (the “Facility Agreement”) and is scheduled to mature in December 2022, as described in Note 3: Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The Facility Agreement was fully drawn as of December 31, 2014. Semi-annual principal repayments began in December 2014. The facility bears interest at a floating LIBOR rate plus a margin of 2.75% through June 2017, increasing by an additional 0.5% each year to a maximum rate of LIBOR plus 5.75%. Ninety-five percent of our obligations under the Facility Agreement are guaranteed by COFACE, the French export credit agency. Our obligations under the Facility Agreement are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by all of our domestic subsidiaries and are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the assets of us and our domestic subsidiaries (other than their FCC licenses), including patents and trademarks, 100% of the equity of our domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the equity of certain foreign subsidiaries.</p>

<p>The Facility Agreement contains customary events of default and requires that we satisfy various financial and non-financial covenants. See Note 3: Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements in our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on these covenants. The financial covenants defined in the Facility Agreement include in their compliance calculation certain cash funds contributed to us from the issuance of our common stock and/or Subordinated Indebtedness. These funds are referred to as &quot;Equity Cure Contributions&quot; and may be funded subsequent to the covenant measurement dates in order to achieve compliance with these covenants subject to the conditions set forth in the Facility Agreement. Each Equity Cure Contribution must be made in a minimum amount of $10 million with no maximum amount for each measurement period or in the aggregate for all periods until the date that such funding is no longer allowed by the Facility Agreement (which will be the case for any period after the measurement period ending June 30, 2017). Equity Cure Contributions that are in excess of the amounts required to achieve the required covenant calculation, as a result of the $10 million minimum per funding, may be applied to determining compliance with future covenant calculations. As previously discussed, in February 2015, we drew $10.0 million under our agreement with Terrapin, which amount was an Equity Cure Contribution under the terms of the Facility Agreement, and issue to Terrapin 4.5 million shares of our voting common stock at an average price of $2.22 per share. As a result, we were in compliance with our financial and non-financial covenants as of December 31, 2014. We anticipate that we will make additional draws under the Terrapin Agreement during 2015 to achieve compliance with our financial covenants under the Facility Agreement.</p>

<p>The Facility Agreement requires us to maintain a total of $37.9 million in a debt service reserve account. The use of the funds in this account is restricted to making principal and interest payments under the Facility Agreement. As of December 31, 2014, the balance in the debt service reserve account was $37.9 million and classified as restricted cash.<br>

<p>The Consent Agreement and the Common Stock Purchase (and Option) Agreement<br>
 <br>
The Consent Agreement<br>
 <br>
On May 20, 2013, we entered into the Consent Agreement with Thermo and the lenders under the Facility Agreement. Pursuant to the Consent Agreement, Thermo agreed that it would make, or arrange for third parties to make, cash contributions to us in exchange for equity, subordinated convertible debt or other equity-linked securities. In accordance with the terms of the Common Stock Purchase Agreement and the Common Stock Purchase and Option Agreement discussed below, Thermo contributed a total of $65.0 million to us in exchange for 171.9 million shares of our nonvoting common stock. As of December 31, 2014, Thermo had fulfilled its obligations under the agreements.<br>
 <br>
The Common Stock Purchase Agreement<br>
 <br>
On May 20, 2013, we and Thermo entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement pursuant to which Thermo purchased 78.1 million shares of our common stock for $25.0 million ($0.32 per share). Thermo also agreed to purchase additional shares of common stock at $0.32 per share as and when required to fulfill its equity commitment described above to maintain our consolidated unrestricted cash balance at not less than $4.0 million until the earlier of July 31, 2013 and the closing of a restructuring of the Facility Agreement. In furtherance thereof, at the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement (as described in Note 3: Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements in our Consolidated Financial Statements), Thermo purchased an additional 15.6 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $5.0 million. In June 2013, Thermo purchased an additional 28.1 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $9.0 million pursuant to the Common Stock Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to its commitment, Thermo invested $6.0 million in July 2013 and $6.5 million in August 2013 on terms determined by a special committee of our board of directors consisting solely of unaffiliated directors as described below.</p>

<p>During 2013, Thermo purchased in total approximately 121.9 million shares of our common stock pursuant to the Common Stock Purchase Agreement for an aggregate $39.0 million, as discussed in the previous paragraph. As a result of these transactions, during the second quarter of 2013, we recognized a loss on the sale of these shares of approximately $14.0 million (included in other income/expense on the consolidated statement of operations), representing the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of our common stock (measured as the closing stock price on the date of each sale).<br>
 <br>
The Common Stock Purchase and Option Agreement<br>
 <br>
On October 14, 2013, we and Thermo entered into a Common Stock Purchase and Option Agreement pursuant to which Thermo agreed to purchase 11.5 million shares of our nonvoting common stock at a purchase price of $0.52 per share in exchange for $6.0 million invested in July 2013 and an additional $20 million, or 38.5 million shares, of which $6.5 million was invested in August 2013 and the remaining $13.5 million was invested under the First Option, described below. The Common Stock Purchase and Option Agreement also granted us a First Option and a Second Option, as defined in the agreement, to sell to Thermo up to $13.5 million and $11.5 million, respectively, of nonvoting common stock, as and when exercised by the special committee, through November 28, 2013 and December 31, 2013, respectively. The First Option to sell up to $13.5 million in shares to Thermo was at a purchase price of $0.52 per share. The Second Option to sell up to $11.5 million in shares to Thermo was at a price equal to 85% of the average closing price of the voting common stock during the ten trading days immediately preceding the date of the special committee’s exercise of the option. In November 2013, with the approval of the special committee we and Thermo amended the Common Stock Purchase and Option Agreement to defer the expiration date of the Second Option to March 31, 2014. The Second Option under the Common Stock Purchase and Option Agreement was not exercised and therefore has expired.<br>
 <br>
During the third quarter of 2013, Thermo purchased approximately 24.0 million shares of our non-voting common stock pursuant to the terms of the Common Stock Purchase and Option Agreement for an aggregate purchase price of $12.5 million.<br>
 <br>
In November 2013, we exercised the First Option, and on December 27, 2013 Thermo purchased 26.0 million shares of our non-voting common stock at a purchase price of $0.52 per share for a total additional investment of $13.5 million.</p>

<p>See Note 3: Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements in our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Consent Agreement and the Common Stock Purchase (and Option) Agreement.<br>
 <br>
Contingent Equity Agreement<br>
 <br>
In June 2009, we entered into a Contingent Equity Agreement with Thermo whereby Thermo agreed to deposit $60.0 million into a contingent equity account to fulfill a condition precedent for borrowing under the Facility Agreement. Under the terms of the Facility Agreement, we had the right to make draws from this account if and to the extent it had an actual or projected deficiency in our ability to meet obligations due within a forward-looking 90-day period.</p>

<p>The Contingent Equity Agreement provided that we would pay Thermo an availability fee of 10% per year for maintaining funds in the contingent equity account. This annual fee was payable solely in warrants to purchase common stock at $0.01 per share with a five-year exercise period from issuance. Since the origination of the Contingent Equity Agreement, we have issued to Thermo warrants to purchase 41,467,980 shares of common stock for the annual availability fee and subsequent resets due to provisions in the Contingent Equity Agreement.<br>
 <br>
As of December 31, 2014, Thermo had exercised warrants to purchase approximately 11.3 million of these shares prior to the expiration of the associated warrants. See Note 3: Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements, Note 4: Derivatives and Note 9: Related Party Transactions in our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the warrants exercised in connection with the Contingent Equity Agreement.<br>
 <br>
We may not issue voting common stock if it would cause Thermo and its affiliates to own more than 70% of our outstanding voting stock. We may issue nonvoting common stock in lieu of common stock to the extent issuing common stock would cause Thermo and its affiliates to exceed this 70% ownership level.</p>

<p>See Note 3: Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements in our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Contingent Equity Agreement.</p>
