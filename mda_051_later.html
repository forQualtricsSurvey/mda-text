<p>Cash Position and Indebtedness<br>
 <br>
As of December 31, 2015, we held cash and cash equivalents of $7.5 million. We also had approximately $37.9 million in restricted cash, which we must maintain through the term of the Facility Agreement and which we will use to pay principal and interest under the Facility Agreement. Additionally, in August 2015, we entered into a new $75.0 million common stock purchase agreement with Terrapin (the &quot;August 2015 Terrapin Agreement&quot;), which is available to be drawn over a 24-month period. As of December 31, 2015, $60.0 million remained available under this agreement. In February 2016, we drew $6.5 million under the August 2015 Terrapin Agreement. See below section for further information.</p>

<p>As of December 31, 2014, we held cash and cash equivalents of $7.1 million, and $24.0 million was available under our prior common stock purchase agreement with Terrapin.<br>
 <br>
The carrying amount of our current and long-term debt outstanding was $32.8 million and $606.2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2015, compared to $6.5 million and $623.6 million, respectively, at December 31, 2014. The current portion of our long-term debt outstanding at these dates represents principal payments under our Facility Agreement scheduled to occur within 12 months. The $8.9 million increase in our total debt balance during 2015 was due primarily to an increase in the carrying value of the Thermo Loan Agreement due to interest accruing on that debt, as well as an increase in the principal balance in connection with the Thermo Equity Agreement entered into in August 2015, and accretion of the debt discounts related to our convertible notes. These increases were offset partially by conversions of a portion of the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 and principal payments under our Facility Agreement.</p>
