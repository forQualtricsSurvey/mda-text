<p>Capital Expenditures<br>
 <br>
We have entered into various contractual agreements related to the procurement and deployment of our second-generation network, as summarized below. The discussion below is based on our current contractual obligations to these contractors.<br>
 <br>
Second-Generation Satellites<br>
 <br>
We have a contract with Thales for the construction of the second-generation low-earth orbit satellites and related services. We successfully completed the launches of our second-generation satellites. Discussions between us and Thales are ongoing regarding certain deliverables under the contract.<br>
 <br>
We had a contract with Arianespace for the launch of these second-generation satellites and certain pre- and post-launch services. All obligations pursuant to this contract have been fulfilled.<br>
  <br>
The amount of capital expenditures incurred as of December 31, 2014, related to the construction and deployment of the satellites for our second-generation constellation and the launch services contract is presented in the table below (in thousands):</p>

<p>As of December 31, 2014, there are no remaining future capital expenditures related to the construction and deployment of the satellites for our second-generation constellation and the launch services contract.<br>
 <br>
Next-Generation Gateways and Other Ground Facilities<br>
 <br>
In May 2008, we entered into an agreement with Hughes to design, supply and implement RAN ground network equipment and software upgrades for installation at a number of our satellite gateway ground stations and satellite interface chips to be used in various of our next-generation devices.</p>

<p>In October 2008, we signed an agreement with Ericsson, a leading global provider of technology and services to telecom operators. Ericsson will work with us to develop, implement and maintain a ground interface, or core network, system that will be installed at a number of our satellite gateway ground stations.</p>

<p>In August 2013, we entered into an agreement with Hughes under which Hughes had the option to receive all or any portion of the deferred payments and accrued interest in our common stock. If Hughes chose to receive any payment in stock, shares would be provided at a 7% discount based upon a trailing volume weighted average price calculation. Hughes elected to receive payment in the form of shares of our common stock for approximately $14.4 million of certain milestone payments and accrued interest. In valuing our obligation to issue discounted shares to Hughes, we recorded a loss of approximately $1.0 million in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013.<br>
 <br>
In September 2013, we entered into an agreement with Ericsson which deferred certain milestone payments previously due under the contract to 2014 and beyond. The deferred payments continue to incur interest at a rate of 6.5% per annum. As of December 31, 2014, we had recorded $3.0 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, excluding interest, related to these required payments and had incurred and capitalized $11.2 million of costs related to this contract. We record the costs as an asset in property and equipment. We are currently negotiating the remaining $0.7 million outstanding as of December 31, 2014.</p>

<p>In December 2013, we amended our contract with Hughes to extend the schedule of the program and to revise the remaining payment milestones and program milestones to reflect the revised program timeline. This amendment extended certain payments previously due in 2013 to 2014 and beyond.</p>

<p>In May 2014, we entered into an agreement with Hughes to incorporate changes to the scope of work for the RAN and UTS being supplied to us. The additional work increased the total contract value by $3.8 million. We also entered into a letter agreement with Hughes whereby Hughes was granted the option to accept the pre-payment of certain payment milestones in the form of our common stock at a 7% discount in lieu of cash. We issued the stock to Hughes on July 1, 2014. The payment milestones totaled $9.9 million. In valuing the shares, we recorded a loss of approximately $0.7 million in our consolidated statement of operations during the second quarter of 2014.</p>

<p>In July 2014, we entered into an amended and restated agreement with Ericsson for our core network system specifying the remaining contract value of $25.4 million for the work and a new milestone schedule to reflect the new program timeline.</p>

<p>In October 2014, we and Hughes formally amended the contract to include the revised scope of work agreed to in the May 2014 letter agreement.  The amendment also adjusted the schedule of the program and the remaining payment milestones and program milestones to incorporate the agreed upon changes. The additional $3.8 million in work agreed to in the May 2014 letter agreement is now reflected in the contract through this amendment.</p>

<p>The following table presents the amount of actual and contractual capital expenditures (excluding capitalized interest) related to the construction of the ground component and related costs and includes both payments made in cash and stock (in thousands):</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>As of December 31, 2014, we had recorded $3.0 million of these capital expenditures in accounts payable.</p>
