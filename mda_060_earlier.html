<p>Revenue Recognition<br>
 <br>
Our primary types of revenue include (i) service revenue from two-way voice communication and data transmissions and one-way data transmissions between a mobile or fixed device and (ii) subscriber equipment revenue from the sale of Duplex two-way transmission products, SPOT consumer retail products, and Simplex one-way transmission products. Additionally, we generate revenue by providing engineering and support services to certain customers. We provide Duplex, SPOT and Simplex services directly to customers and indirectly through resellers and IGOs.</p>

<p>Duplex Service Revenue<br>
 <br>
For our Duplex customers and resellers, we recognize revenue for monthly access fees in the period we render services.  Access fees represent the minimum monthly charge for each line of service based on its associated rate plan. We also recognize revenue for airtime minutes in excess of the monthly access fees in the period such minutes are used. Under certain annual plans where customers prepay for a predetermined amount of minutes, we defer revenue until the minutes are used or the prepaid time period expires. Unused minutes accumulate until they expire, at which point we recognize revenue for any remaining unused minutes. For annual access fees charged for certain annual plans, we recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the plan.<br>
 <br>
We expense or charge credits granted to customers against revenue or deferred revenue upon issuance.<br>
 <br>
We expense subscriber acquisition costs, including such items as dealer commissions and internal sales commissions at the time of the related sale, except as it relates to certain multi-deliverable contracts.<br>
 <br>
SPOT and Simplex Service Revenue<br>
 <br>
We sell SPOT and Simplex services as annual or multi-year plans and recognize revenue ratably over the service term or as service is used, beginning when the service is activated by the customer. We record amounts received in advance as deferred revenue.<br>
 <br>
IGO Service Revenue<br>
 <br>
We earn a portion of our revenues through the sale of airtime minutes or data packages on a wholesale basis to IGOs. We recognize revenue from services provided to IGOs based upon airtime minutes or data packages used by their customers and in accordance with contractual fee arrangements. If collection is uncertain, we recognize revenue when cash payment is received.<br>
 <br>
Equipment Revenue<br>
 <br>
Subscriber equipment revenue represents the sale of fixed and mobile user terminals, accessories and our SPOT and Simplex products. We recognize revenue upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed and determinable, and collection is probable.<br>
 <br>
Other Service Revenue<br>
 <br>
We also provide certain engineering services to assist customers in developing new technologies related to our system. We recognize the revenues associated with these services when the services are rendered, and we recognize the expenses when incurred.</p>
