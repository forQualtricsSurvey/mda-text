<p>Terrapin Opportunity, L.P. Common Stock Purchase Agreement</p>

<p>On December 28, 2012 we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with Terrapin pursuant to which we were entitled, subject to certain conditions, to require Terrapin to purchase up to $30.0 million of shares of our voting common stock over the 24-month term beginning on August 2, 2013. From time to time over the 24-month term, and in our sole discretion, we could present Terrapin with up to 36 draw down notices requiring Terrapin to purchase a specified dollar amount of shares of our voting common stock. We agreed not to sell Terrapin a number of shares of voting common stock that, when aggregated with all other shares of voting common stock then beneficially owned by Terrapin and its affiliates, would result in the beneficial ownership by Terrapin or any of its affiliates of more than 9.9% of our then issued and outstanding shares of voting common stock. When we made a draw under this agreement, we issued shares of common stock to Terrapin at a price per share calculated as specified in the agreement. In September 2013, we drew $6.0 million under our agreement with Terrapin and issued 6.1 million shares of voting common stock to Terrapin at an average price of $0.98 per share. In February 2015, we drew $10.0 million and issued 4.5 million shares of voting common stock at an average price of $2.22 per share and in June 2015, we drew the remaining $14.0 million under our agreement with Terrapin and issued 6.6 million shares of voting common stock at an average price of $2.13 per share. Through the term of this agreement, Terrapin purchased a total of 17.2 million shares of voting common stock at a total purchase price of $30.0 million. No funds remain available under this agreement.</p>

<p>In conjunction with the amendment to the Facility Agreement in August 2015 (as discussed above), we entered into the August 2015 Terrapin Agreement pursuant to which we may require Terrapin to purchase up to $75.0 million of shares of our voting common stock over the 24-month term following the date of the agreement. Over the 24-month term, in our discretion, we may present Terrapin with up to 24 draw notices requiring Terrapin to purchase a specified dollar amount of shares of our voting common stock, based on the price per share per day over ten consecutive trading days (a &quot;Draw Down Period&quot;). The per share purchase price for these shares will equal the daily volume weighted average price of common stock on each date during the Draw Down Period on which shares are purchased by Terrapin (but not less than a minimum price specified by us (a “Threshold Price”)), less a discount ranging from 2.75% to 4.00% based on the amount of the Threshold Price. In addition, in our discretion, but subject to certain limitations, we may grant to Terrapin the option to purchase additional shares during the Draw Down Period. We have agreed not to sell to Terrapin a number of shares of voting common stock which, when aggregated with all other shares of voting common stock then beneficially owned by Terrapin and its affiliates, would result in their beneficial ownership of more than 9.9% of the number of our shares of voting common stock issued and outstanding at the date of the sale. As previously discussed, Thermo committed to purchase up to $30.0 million of our equity securities if we require it to do so or if there is an event of default under the Facility Agreement and funds are not available under the August 2015 Terrapin Agreement.</p>

<p>In August 2015, we drew $15.0 million under the August 2015 Terrapin Agreement and issued 9.3 million shares of voting common stock to Terrapin at an average price of $1.61 per share. In February 2016, we drew $6.5 million under the August 2015 Terrapin Agreement and issued 6.4 million shares of voting common stock to Terrapin at an average price of $1.02 per share. Currently, $53.5 million remains available under the August 2015 Terrapin Agreement. We expect to make draws from time to time under the August 2015 Terrapin Agreement to be used as Equity Cure Contributions under the Facility Agreement or for general corporate purposes. See Note 3: Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements in our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Terrapin agreement.</p>
