<p>New Accounting Pronouncements</p>

<p>In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), (“ASU 2014-09”). The purpose of ASU 2014-09 is to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and create a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2014-09 affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (for example, insurance contracts or lease contracts). The amendments in ASU 2014-09 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years. The following subsequent Accounting Standards Updates either clarified or revised guidance set forth in ASU 2014-09:<br>
 <br>
 	•	 	<br>
In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, (“ASU 2015-14”). ASU 2015-14 defers the effective date of Accounting Standards Update 2014-09: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), (“ASU 2014-09). The guidance in ASU 2014-09 is now effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.</p>

<p>•	 	<br>
In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenues Gross versus Net), (“ASU 2016-08”). The purpose of ASU 2016-08 is to clarify the implementation of revenue recognition guidance related to principal versus agent considerations.</p>

<p>•	 	<br>
In April 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, (“ASU 2016-10”). The purpose of ASU 2016-10 is to clarify certain aspects of identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation guidance.</p>

<p>•	 	<br>
In May 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, (“ASU 2016-12”). The purpose of ASU 2016-12 is to address certain narrow aspects of ASC Topic 606 including assessing collectability, presentation of sales and other similar taxes, noncash considerations, contract modifications and completed contracts at transition.</p>

<p>•	 	<br>
In December 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (“ASU 2016-20”). The purpose of ASU 2016-20 is to amend certain narrow aspects of the guidance issued in ASU 2014-09 including guidance related to the disclosure of remaining performance obligations and prior-period performance obligations, as well as other amendments to the guidance on loan guarantee fees, contract costs, refund liabilities, advertising costs and the clarification of certain examples.</p>

<p>The amendments in these accounting standards updates may be applied either using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the guidance is effective or retrospectively to each period presented. Early adoption is permitted. We will adopt the amendments within these accounting standards updates in the first quarter of 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact of these accounting standards updates on our consolidated financial statements, specifically with respect to our Exhibitor Services Agreement with NCM, loyalty program accounting, breakage income for stored value cards as well as other ancillary and contractual revenues.<br>
In February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, (“ASU 2015-02”). ASU 2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. Specifically, ASU 2015-02 modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities (VIEs) or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with certain VIEs. ASU 2015-02 also provides a scope exception from consolidation guidance for reporting entities with interests in legal entities that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds. ASU 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. Effective January 1, 2016, we adopted ASU 2015-02, which had no impact on our consolidated financial statements.</p>

<p>In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), (“ASU 2016-02”). The purpose of ASU 2016-02 is to provide financial statement users a better understanding of the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 will result in the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for most operating leases. New disclosure requirements include qualitative and quantitative information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. ASU 2016-02 requires a modified retrospective transition by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the guidance is effective with the option to elect certain practical expedients. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements.</p>

<p>In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-04, Liabilities — Extinguishment of Liabilities (Subtopic 405-20), (“ASU 2016-04”). The purpose of ASU 2016-04 is to provide a narrow scope exception to the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Subtopic 405-20 to require that breakage of liabilities associated with prepaid stored-value products be accounted for consistent with the breakage guidance in ASC Topic 606. ASU 2016-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments in ASU 2016-04 may be applied either using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the guidance is effective or retrospectively to each period presented. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-04 on our consolidated financial statements.</p>

<p>In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-07, Investments —Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), (“ASU 2016-07”). The purpose of ASU 2016-07 is to eliminate the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment was held. ASU 2016-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments in ASU 2016-07 should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect ASU 2016-07 to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.</p>

<p>In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, Compensation — Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, (“ASU 2016-09”). The purpose of ASU 2016-09 is to simplify the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification of such activity on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that year. Prospective, retrospective, or modified retrospective application may be used dependent on the specific requirements of the amendments within ASU 2016-09. We will adopt ASU 2016-09 on a prospective basis during the first interim period of 2017. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-09, we will revise our future diluted earnings per share calculations to exclude the estimated tax benefits and deficiencies in the application of the treasury stock method, which will impact the number of dilutive shares included in the diluted earnings per share calculation. Excess tax benefits or deficiencies related to share based awards will be recognized as discrete items in the income statement during the period in which they occur. We will continue to estimate forfeitures for our share based awards after adoption of ASU 2016-09.<br>
In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments — a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force, (“ASU 2016-15”). The purpose of ASU 2016-15 is to reduce the diversity in practice regarding how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year. A retrospective transition method should be used in the application of the amendments within ASU 2016-15. If retrospective application is considered impracticable, retrospective application may be used as of the earliest date practicable. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-15 on our consolidated financial statements.</p>

<p>In October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, (“ASU 2016-16”). The purpose of ASU 2016-16 is to improve the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. ASU 2016-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year. A modified retrospective transition method should be used in the application of the amendments within ASU 2016-16 with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-16 on our consolidated financial statements.</p>

<p>In November 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash — a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force, (“ASU 2016-18”). The purpose of ASU 2016-18 is to provide guidance on the presentation of restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. Specifically, ASU 2016-18 requires companies to include amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in cash and cash equivalents when reconciling beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year. The amendments in ASU 2016-18 should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect ASU 2016-18 to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.</p>

<p>In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business, (“ASU 2017-01”). The purpose of ASU 2017-01 is to clarify the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. ASU 2017-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year. The amendments in ASU 2017-01 should be applied prospectively on or after the effective date. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect ASU 2017-01 to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.</p>

<p>In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-04, Intangibles — Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, (“ASU 2017-04”). The purpose of ASU 2017-04 is to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by removing the second step of the two-step impairment test. The amendment should be applied on a prospective basis. ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that year. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.
