<p>Liquidity</p>

<p>Our principal sources of liquidity are available cash, cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. We have also raised capital in the past through the public equity and debt markets, and we regularly explore various other financing alternatives. Our principal uses of cash are the funding of operating costs (including post-retirement benefits), maintenance of curtailed production facilities, payments of principal and interest on our outstanding debt, the funding of capital expenditures, investments in our growth activities and in related businesses, working capital and other general corporate requirements.</p>

<p>Our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2014 was approximately $163 million compared to $84 million at December 31, 2013.</p>

<p>Availability Under Our Credit Facilities</p>

<p>We have in place a senior secured revolving credit facility, dated May 24, 2013, as amended, with a syndicate of lenders which provides for borrowings of up to $150 million in the aggregate (the &quot;U.S. revolving credit facility&quot;). We have also entered into, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Nordural Grundartangi ehf, a $50 million revolving credit facility, dated November 27, 2013 (the &quot;Iceland revolving credit facility&quot;). Century&#x27;s U.S. revolving credit facility matures in May 2018 and our Iceland revolving credit facility matures in November 2016.</p>

<p>As of December 31, 2014, our credit facilities had no amounts outstanding and approximately $89 million of net availability. We borrow and make repayments under our credit facilities in the ordinary course based on a number of factors, including the timing of payments from our customers and payments to our suppliers. Borrowings and repayments under our credit facilities for the year ended December 31, 2014 on a gross basis were approximately $92.4 million and $98.4 million, respectively. During the same period, total outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities at any given time did not exceed $16.7 million.</p>

<p>In connection with the Mt. Holly acquisition, and in part to cover new security obligations relating to the power arrangement with Santee Cooper for Mt. Holly, we amended the U.S. revolving credit facility to increase our letter of credit sub-facility to $130 million for the period commencing on December 1, 2014 and ending on March 1, 2015 and to $100 million thereafter. As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $111 million of letters of credit outstanding under our U.S. revolving credit facility. With the acquisition of Mt. Holly, Santee Cooper required us to post a $60 million letter of credit to secure our power obligations under the existing power contract. This letter of credit reduces automatically on a monthly basis beginning on April 1, 2015 by between $4 and $6 million until the letter of credit expires in February 2016. We are in discussions with Santee Cooper regarding power arrangements at Mt. Holly following December 31, 2015 and we may be required to post additional security in the form of letters of credit at such time.</p>

<p>In addition, on January 1, 2015, EDF replaced Big Rivers as our market participant with MISO for our power supply arrangements in Kentucky. The transition to EDF reduced our outstanding letters of credit by approximately $40 million.</p>

<p>The availability of funds under our credit facilities is limited by a specified borrowing base consisting of certain accounts receivable and inventory. Our metal sales agreements for 2015 have shorter payment terms than we have had historically. The shorter payment term will reduce our accounts receivable, which comprise part of the borrowing base of our revolving credit facilities, and could result in a corresponding reduction in availability under the revolving credit facilities. Although, the shorter payment terms will reduce our borrowing base, it should improve our cash and cash equivalents balance by accelerating payments from our customer and reducing finished goods inventory on-hand. In addition, any future curtailments of production capacity would reduce accounts receivable and inventory with similar effect.</p>

<p>Senior Secured Notes</p>

<p>We have $250 million in 7.5% senior secured notes payable that will mature on June 1, 2021. In the third quarter of 2014, we retired our remaining 7.5% senior unsecured notes due August 2014 with a $2.6 million payment to the noteholders.</p>

<p>Acquisitions</p>

<p>On December 1, 2014, we acquired Alcoa’s 50.3% stake in Mt. Holly for $67.5 million in cash less certain amounts owed by Alumax to the Mt. Holly operating partnership and for certain post-employment retiree medical obligations. The acquisition is also subject to adjustments for working capital and a true-up process intended to place the parties in approximately the same economic position as they would have been in had the acquisition closed on September 30, 2014. In December 2014, we made an initial payment of $53.8 million with available cash on hand. In the second quarter of 2015, we expect to make an additional payment of approximately $40.8 million, primarily related to pension funding. In addition, the purchase agreement provides for a post-closing cash payment to be made following December 31, 2015 based on changes in the Midwest Transaction Price between July 2, 2014 and December 31, 2015 and production levels at Mt. Holly from October 1, 2014 through December 31, 2015. The maximum amount of this post-closing cash payment by Century to Alcoa is $22.5 million and by Alcoa to Century is $12.5 million. See Note 2 Business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information.</p>

<p>Contingent Commitments</p>

<p>We have a contingent obligation to E.ON which consists of the aggregate E.ON payments made to Big Rivers on CAKY’s behalf in excess of the agreed upon base amount under the long-term cost-based power contract with Kenergy. As of December 31, 2014, the principal and accrued interest for the E.ON contingent obligation was $18.2 million, which was fully offset by a derivative asset. We may be required to make installment payments for the E.ON contingent obligation in the future. These payments are contingent based on the LME price of primary aluminum and the level of Hawesville’s operations. Based on the LME forward market at December 31, 2014 and management’s estimate of the LME forward market beyond the quoted market period, we have assessed that we will not be required to make payments on the E.ON contingent obligation during the term of the agreement through 2028. There can be no assurance that circumstances will not change thus accelerating the timing of such payments. See Note 5 Derivative and hedging instruments and Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information.</p>

<p>Employee Benefit Plan Contributions</p>

<p>In April 2013, we entered into a settlement agreement with the PBGC regarding an alleged &quot;cessation of operations&quot; at our Ravenswood facility as a result of the curtailment of operations at the facility. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we will make additional contributions (above any minimum required contributions) to our defined benefit pension plans over the term of the agreement. The remaining contributions under this agreement are approximately $10.7 million, of which approximately $3.7 million was scheduled to be made in 2014. Under certain circumstances, in periods of low primary aluminum prices relative to our operations, we may defer one or more of these payments, but we would be required to provide the PBGC with acceptable security for any deferred payments. In 2014 and 2015, we elected to defer contributions under the PBGC agreement and have provided the PBGC with the appropriate security.</p>

<p>In addition to the contributions required pursuant to the PBGC settlement, based on current actuarial and other assumptions, we expect to make minimum required contributions to the qualified defined benefit plans and unqualified supplemental executive retirement benefits (&quot;SERB&quot;) plan of approximately $3.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively, for total pension contributions of $5.3 million during 2015. We may choose to make additional contributions to these plans from time to time at our discretion.</p>

<p>Other Items</p>

<p>During the second quarter of 2014, Nordural ehf participated in the 50/50 ISK Auctions (the &quot;Auctions&quot;) sponsored by the Central Bank of Iceland (&quot;CBI&quot;) and may participate in future auctions. The Auctions allow authorized investors to exchange foreign currency for ISK with 50% exchanged at the official rate set by the CBI and 50% exchanged at the auction rate. The ISK received in the Auction must be invested in Iceland for a minimum of five years.</p>

<p>During 2014, we paid Icelandic withholding taxes on intercompany dividends of approximately $5.5 million. We anticipate these payments will be refunded in November 2015. In November 2014, we received a refund for Icelandic withholding taxes paid in 2013 of $9.5 million. The withholding taxes and associated refunds are payable in Icelandic kronur (&quot;ISK&quot;) and we are subject to foreign currency risk associated with fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared the ISK.</p>

<p>In August 2011, our Board of Directors approved a $60 million common stock repurchase program. Through December 31, 2014, we had expended approximately $50 million under the program. In February 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a $20 million increase in the stock repurchase plan. In 2015 through February 27, 2015, we repurchased $5.8 million of our common stock. As of March 2, 2015, we had $24.3 million remaining under the repurchase program authorization. The repurchase program may be expanded, suspended or discontinued by our Board, in its sole discretion, at any time.</p>

<p>In June 2012, Nordural Grundartangi ehf entered into a new supplemental power contract with Landsvirkjun. The supplemental power contract, which will expire in October 2029 (or upon the occurrence of certain earlier events), will provide Nordural Grundartangi ehf with supplemental power, as Nordural Grundartangi ehf may request from time to time, at LME-based variable rates. Nordural Grundartangi ehf has agreed to make certain prepayments to Landsvirkjun for power expected to be used at a later date in connection with the contract, which will reduce the price paid for power at the time of consumption. As of December 31, 2014, these power prepayments totaled approximately $2.1 million.</p>

<p>We are also defendant in several actions relating to various aspects of our business. While it is impossible to predict the ultimate disposition of any litigation, we do not believe that any of these lawsuits, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. See Note 15 Commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information.</p>
