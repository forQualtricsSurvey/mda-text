<p>Results of Operations</p>

<p>2014 Compared with 2013:</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>Net sales in 2014 dropped by 22% over the prior year, primarily due to the impact of carryover corn products inventory in the Midwest distribution channel. This condition arose from vigorous procurement of these products in 2012 and early 2013, followed by adverse weather conditions that reduced usage during the 2013 planting season. Throughout 2014, many distributors, retailers and corn growers were still drawing down their inventories of the Company’s corn products and reduced their orders materially. With that reduced purchasing from the Company, we have seen the level of excess inventory of these products decline significantly. The combined sales of our corn herbicide and our granular soil insecticides declined by more than 55% in 2014, from the prior year, and in fact this decline in our corn product sales constituted virtually all of the overall revenue drop in 2014.</p>

<p>Market conditions in our non-corn products were balanced in 2014, resulting in nearly neutral results for those crop sectors. While cotton planting increased approximately one million acres above the prior year, lighter foliar pest pressure and inclement late season weather (hail in Arkansas and frost in Texas) resulted in a relatively flat performance for our cotton products. Modest gains by our products for the potato market were offset by slightly weaker sales in some of our specialty applications for vegetable/fruit markets and pharmaceuticals.</p>

<p>Overall financial performance for the year ended December 31, 2014 was significantly reduced as compared to the same period in 2013, with both net sales and net income lower. The Company’s total net sales for the period were down nearly 22% to $298,634, as compared to $381,021 for the year ended December 31, 2013. Net sales of our crop business in 2014 were $267,710, which constitutes a decrease of nearly 23% as compared to net sales of $346,514 for that business in 2013. Net sales of our non-crop products in 2014 were $30,924, which is a reduction of approximately 10% as compared to $34,507 in 2013. A more detailed discussion of product groups and products having a material effect on net sales for each of the crop and non-crop businesses appears below.</p>

<p>In our Crop business, net sales of insecticides in 2014 ended at $135,705, which was a 30% decline as compared to $193,623 in 2013. Within the Crop business, annual net sales of our granular soil insecticides were $106,478, down nearly 37% below 2013, driven by reduced restocking orders for our primary corn soil insecticides – Aztec®, Smartchoice®, Force and Counter®. These declines were slightly offset by year-over-year increases in Thimet, Nemacur, and Mocap, much of that coming from our international business. Among our non-granular insecticide products for crop applications, net sales of Bidrin, bifenthrin, permethrin and acephate remained relatively flat with the prior year.</p>

<p>Within the product group of herbicides/soil fumigants/fungicides, our crop net sales in 2014 were down 16% to $101,785 vs. $121,042 in 2013. Within this group, we had mixed results. The positive drivers were our fumigant and fungicide products posting a combined gain of approximately 3% with stronger potato usage contributing to both categories. Conversely, weak Midwest restocking demand for our post-emergent corn herbicide Impact resulted in a 39% decline in our herbicide category. Within our other products group (which includes plant growth regulators, molluscicides and third party manufacturing activity), we experienced a decrease of 5% in net sales, with net sales of $30,220 in 2014 vs. $31,849 in 2013. The major drivers of this performance were modest declines in our cotton defoliant Folex, our specialty fruit product NAA, and our molluscicide Metaldehyde.</p>

<p>Within our non-crop business, 2014 net sales were down by 10% to $30,924 vs. $34,507 recorded in 2013. Naled® sales (our Dibrom brand mosquito adulticide) were down nearly 14% due to light Gulf Coast storm activity offset by a 31% increase in our pest strips business. Additionally, net sales of our PCNB fungicide for turf uses were flat. Finally, we experienced a year-over-year decline in Pharmaceutical sales of approximately 14%, primarily due to continuing generic competition from Chinese suppliers.</p>

<p>Our cost of sales for 2014 was $184,138 or 62% of net sales. This compared to $209,674 or 55% of net sales for 2013. The increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales in 2014 arose primarily as a result of increased under recovery of factory costs, which increased cost of sales from 55% in 2013, to 60% in 2014. In addition, raw material costs have remained relatively flat during 2014 while factory costs increased slightly. Overall, the inflation in cost of goods sold has amounted to approximately three quarters of one percent of sales. The balance of the increase in cost of goods as a percentage of sales is attributed to the specific mix of sales in 2014, as compared to 2013.</p>

<p>Gross profit for 2014 declined by $56,851 to end at $114,496 for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to $171,347 for the prior year. Gross margin percentage for 2014 declined by 7% and ended at 38%, as compared to 45% for 2013. The majority of the reduction is driven by the 5% impact of increased factory cost under recovery mentioned above. In addition, a further reduction of 2% in gross margin percentage was caused by a combination of changes in product volume and mix, and increases in factory costs due to inflation.</p>

<p>Operating expenses in 2014 decreased by $7,826 to $107,786 or 36% of sales as compared to $115,612 or 30% in 2013. The differences in operating expenses by department are as follows:</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>•	 	Selling expenses decreased by $1,336 to end at $31,593 for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to $32,929 in 2013. The main drivers for the decrease are cost reduction actions across a range of expenses including reduced travel and administration of our foreign subsidiaries.<br>
 <br>
 	•	 	General and administrative expenses decreased by $6,479 to $27,057 for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to $33,536 in 2013. The main drivers for the reduced expenses are lower incentive compensation, and lower legal costs. These cost reductions were partly offset by the expenses associated with a reduction in personnel during the final quarter of the year and the write-off of an impaired intangible asset.<br>
 <br>
 	•	 	Research, product development costs and regulatory expenses decreased by $438 to $21,206 for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to $21,644 in 2013. This change is primarily driven by a decrease in the use of outside legal services for registration review and other registration expenses.<br>
 <br>
 	•	 	Freight, delivery and warehousing costs for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $427 to $27,930, as compared to $27,503 in 2013. As a percentage of sales, freight costs increased to 9.3% of net sales during 2014, as compared to 7.2% of net sales during 2013. This is primarily due to high volume of our heavier products such as fumigants sold domestically, continued growth of our international business and storage costs for higher-than-normal levels of inventory.<br>
Net interest expense was $3,066 in 2014, as compared to $1,901 in 2013. Interest costs are summarized in the following table:</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>The Company’s average overall debt for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $95,060 as compared to $52,872 for the comparable period of the previous year. As can be seen from the above table, on a gross basis, our effective interest rate decreased to 2.5%, as compared to 3.4% in 2013, due to lower interest rates on our new senior credit facility agreement. After deductions of capitalized interest and including expenses related to the amortization of deferred liabilities, our effective rate was 3.2% for 2014 as compared to 3.6% in 2013. Lower amortization of discounting on deferred liabilities related to product line acquisitions contributed to the reduction in our effective interest rate in 2014. The table below shows the amount of outstanding debt and the related notional amount on the interest rate swap contract at each of the balance sheet dates:</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>Income tax benefit for 2014 was $451, as compared to an expense of $18,916 for 2013. The effective tax rate for 2013 was 35%, whereas for 2014 the benefit was 12.4%. The lower effective tax rate was driven by the increase in income in foreign tax jurisdictions where tax rates are lower than the U.S. statutory rates and lower income generated in the U.S. Further, there was a benefit of $328 related to the release of the reserve for a discrete item. The release of the income tax reserve resulted from the lapse of a statute for a tax year in which the Company is no longer subject to examination. The decrease in the tax rate is partially offset by the reduction in the domestic production deduction resulting from carryback to 2012 of certain tax attributes.</p>

<p>For the year ended December 31, 2014, we included losses on equity investment of $983, as compared to $986 in the same period of 2013. This loss was offset by a gain in dilution of the Company’s shareholding in the amount of $954 at December 31, 2014. No gain was recognized in 2013. In 2014 we adjusted our net income attributable to American Vanguard by $775 for the non-controlling interest’s share of the net losses of our majority-owned subsidiary, Envance, as compared to $517 in 2013. In 2012, the adjustment to our net income attributable to American Vanguard for such losses was $41.</p>

<p>Net income attributable to American Vanguard ended at $4,841 or $0.17 per diluted share in 2014 as compared to $34,449 or $1.19 per diluted share in 2013.</p>
