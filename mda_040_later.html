<p>4.875% Senior Notes</p>

<p>On May 24, 2013, Cinemark USA, Inc. issued $530.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due 2023, at par value, (the “4.875% Senior Notes”). Interest on the 4.875% Senior Notes is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The 4.875% Senior Notes mature on June 1, 2023.</p>

<p>On March 21, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. issued an additional $225.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.875% Senior Notes, at 99.0% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest from December 1, 2015.  Proceeds, after payment of fees, were used to finance the redemption of Cinemark, USA, Inc.’s previously outstanding $200.0 million 7.375% senior subordinated notes due 2021 (the “7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes”), as discussed below. These additional notes have identical terms, other than the issue date, the issue price and the first interest payment date, and constitute part of the same series as Cinemark USA, Inc.’s existing 4.875% Senior Notes.  The aggregate principal amount of $755.0 million of 4.875% Senior Notes mature on June 1, 2023.  The Company incurred debt issue costs of approximately $3.7 million in connection with the issuance of the additional notes, which, along with the discount of $2.3 million, are reflected as a reduction of long term debt, net of accumulated amortization, on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017.</p>

<p>The 4.875% Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior unsecured basis by certain of Cinemark USA, Inc.’s subsidiaries that guarantee, assume or become liable with respect to any of Cinemark USA, Inc.’s or a guarantor’s debt. The 4.875% Senior Notes and the guarantees are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of Cinemark USA, Inc.’s and its guarantor’s existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior in right of payment to all of Cinemark USA, Inc.’s and its guarantor’s existing and future senior subordinated debt. The 4.875% Senior Notes and the guarantees are effectively subordinated to all of Cinemark USA, Inc.’s and its guarantor’s existing and future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt, including all borrowings under Cinemark USA, Inc.’s Credit Agreement. The 4.875% Senior Notes and the guarantees are structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt and other liabilities of Cinemark USA, Inc.’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the 4.875% Senior Notes.</p>

<p>The indenture to the 4.875% Senior Notes contains covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of Cinemark USA, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries to (1) make investments or other restricted payments, including paying dividends, making other distributions or repurchasing subordinated debt or equity, (2) incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock, (3) enter into transactions with affiliates, (4) enter new lines of business, (5) merge or consolidate with, or sell all or substantially all of its assets to, another person and (6) create liens. As of December 31, 2017, Cinemark USA, Inc. could have distributed up to approximately $2,608.2 million to its parent company and sole stockholder, Cinemark Holdings, Inc., under the terms of the indenture to the 4.875% Senior Notes, subject to its available cash and other borrowing restrictions outlined in the indenture. Upon a change of control, as defined in the indenture governing the 4.875% Senior Notes, Cinemark USA, Inc. would be required to make an offer to repurchase the 4.875% Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, through the date of repurchase. The indenture governing the 4.875% Senior Notes allows Cinemark USA, Inc. to incur additional indebtedness if it satisfies the coverage ratio specified in the indenture, after giving effect to the incurrence of the additional indebtedness, and in certain other circumstances. The required minimum coverage ratio is 2 to 1 and our actual ratio as of December 31, 2017 was approximately 6.1 to 1.</p>

<p>Prior to June 1, 2018, Cinemark USA, Inc. may redeem all or any part of the 4.875%  Senior Notes at its option at 100% of the principal amount plus a make-whole premium plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 4.875%  Senior Notes to the date of redemption. After June 1, 2018, Cinemark USA, Inc. may redeem the 4.875% Senior Notes in whole or in part at redemption prices specified in the indenture.</p>
