<p>Results of Operations<br>
 <br>
For the results of operations discussed below, we compare the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 to the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013.<br>
 <br>
Revenue from the sale of metals.  We recorded $0.2 million and $10.7 million of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, all from the sale of metals from our Velardeña Properties in Mexico. The decrease in revenue in 2014 is primarily the result of the suspension of mining and processing at our Velardeña Properties from June 2013 until processing mined material resumed in November 2014, as discussed above.<br>
 <br>
Costs of metals sold.  We recorded $1.7 million and $17.5 million of costs applicable to sales for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease in cost of metals sold in 2014 is primarily the result of the suspension of mining and processing at our Velardeña Properties from June 2013 until mining activity resumed in July 2014 and processing resumed in November 2014, as discussed above. Included in costs of metals sold for the period ended December 31, 2014 was a $1.2 million write down of finished goods inventory to estimated net realizable value.<br>
 <br>
Exploration Expense.  Our exploration expense, including property holding costs and allocated administrative expenses, totaled $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.  Exploration expense for both years was incurred primarily in Mexico, Peru, and Argentina (excluding amounts spent on the Yaxtché deposit at the El Quevar project) and includes property holding costs and costs incurred by our local exploration offices. The increase in exploration expenses in 2014 is primarily related to the 2014 drilling program at our Velardeña Properties.<br>
 <br>
Velardeña Project Expense.  During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 we incurred approximately $3.1 million and $3.1 million of expenses, respectively, primarily related to the restart of mining and processing activities in 2014 and the construction of the San Mateo ramp and other mine construction and engineering work in 2013 at our Velardeña Properties.  In addition to amounts expensed, we incurred capital expenditures of approximately $0.5 million and $1.8 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively for plant construction, mining and other equipment.<br>
 <br>
Velardeña shutdown and care and maintenance costs.  We recorded $2.5 million and $6.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, for expenses related to shutdown and care and maintenance at our Velardeña Properties as the result of the suspension of mining and processing activities at the Velardeña Properties from June 2013 until mining activity resumed in July 2014 and processing mined material resumed in November 2014, as discussed above.<br>
 <br>
El Quevar Project Expense.  During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 we incurred $1.6 million and $2.6 million of expenses, respectively, primarily related to furthering our evaluation and holding costs for the Yaxtché deposit at our El Quevar project in Argentina. The reduction in costs for 2014 is primarily the result of placing the El Quevar project in a holding and maintenance state during 2014.  For both years, costs incurred for work performed outside of the Yaxtché deposit in Argentina are included in “—Exploration Expense”, discussed above.<br>
 <br>
Administrative Expense.  Administrative expenses totaled $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Administrative expenses, including costs associated with being a public company, are incurred primarily by our corporate activities in support of the Velardeña Properties, El Quevar project and our exploration portfolio. The $4.6 million of administrative expenses we incurred during 2014 is comprised of $1.9 million of employee compensation and directors’ fees, $1.2 million of professional fees and $1.5 million of insurance, rents, travel expenses, utilities and other office costs. The $5.6 million of administrative expenses we incurred during 2013 is comprised of $2.2 million of employee compensation and directors’ fees, $1.4 million of professional fees and $2.0 million of insurance, travel expenses, rents, utilities and other office costs.  Administrative expenses were lower in 2014 due primarily to fewer staff employees and lower auditing and other professional fees.</p>

<p>Stock based compensation.  During the year ended December 31, 2014 we incurred expense related to stock based compensation in the amount of $0.9 million compared to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Stock based compensation varies from period to period depending on the number and timing of shares granted, the type of grant, the market value of the shares on the date of grant and other variables.<br>
 <br>
Reclamation and accretion expense.  During each of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 we incurred $0.2 million of reclamation expense related to the accretion of an asset retirement obligation at the Velardeña Properties.<br>
 <br>
Impairment of long lived assets and goodwill.  We assess the recoverability of our long lived assets, including goodwill, at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may be impaired.  There was no impairment of our long lived assets for the year ended December 31, 2014.   During 2013, the significant decrease in metals prices and the shutdown of mining and processing at the Velardeña Properties during June 2013 were events that required an assessment of the recoverability of the Velardeña Properties asset group and goodwill.  We completed an impairment analysis using a market valuation approach which relies upon assumptions related to the Velardeña Properties asset group in comparison to other corroborated observable market data.  At June 30, 2013 we determined that both the long lived assets and the goodwill associated with the Velardeña Properties and the San Diego property were impaired.  As a result at June 30, 2013 we recorded a $237.8 million impairment charge related to the long lived assets and an $11.2 million impairment charge related to goodwill.  At December 31, 2013 we reviewed the remaining carrying value of the long lived assets and goodwill based on the corroborated observable market data at that date and determined that the long lived assets and goodwill were further impaired.  As a result, at December 31, 2013 we recorded an additional $6.1 million impairment charge related to the long lived assets and a $0.5 million impairment charge related to goodwill which reduced the carrying value of the goodwill to zero.<br>
 <br>
Other Operating Income, Net.  We recorded other operating income of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The net amounts for both years consist primarily of net gains recorded on the sales of certain fixed assets and non-strategic exploration properties.<br>
 <br>
Depreciation, depletion and amortization.  During the year ended December 31, 2014 we incurred depreciation, depletion and amortization expense of $3.1 million compared to $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Depreciation, depletion and amortization includes a $0.6 million write down of finished goods inventory to estimated net realizable value at December 31, 2014. There was no write down of finished goods inventory at December 31, 2013. The decrease in depreciation, depletion and amortization in 2014 is primarily the result of the impairment of long lived assets at the Velardeña Properties during 2013 which resulted in a significant decrease in the carrying value of property, plant and equipment.<br>
 <br>
Interest and Other Income.  During the year ended December 31, 2014 we recorded approximately $1.7 million of interest and other income primarily related to the reduction of a loss contingency liability related to foreign withholding taxes that the government could assert are owed by the Company, acting as withholding agent, on certain interest payments made to a third party. We recorded interest and other income of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily related to this loss contingency liability.<br>
 <br>
Warrant Income.  During the year ended December 31, 2014 we recorded approximately $1.8 million of other income related to a decrease in the fair value of the liability recorded for warrants to acquire the Company’s stock (see Note 15 of our consolidated financial statements filed as part of this annual report on Form 10-K). The warrant liability has been recorded at fair value as of December 31, 2014 based primarily on a valuation performed by a third party expert using a Monte Carlo simulation, which falls within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  The valuation model takes into account the probability that the Company could issue additional shares in a future transaction at a lower price than the current exercise price of the warrants.  Significant inputs to the valuation model included the Company’s closing stock price at December 31, 2014 of $0.54, the exercise prices for the warrants disclosed in Note 15 of our consolidated financial statements, the Company’s stock volatility of 90%, the applicable risk free interest rate of 1.6%, and the probability of an additional issuance of the Company’s common stock at a lower price than the current warrant exercise price.<br>
 <br>
Gain (Loss) on Foreign Currency.  We recorded a $0.1 million foreign currency gain for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to a $0.6 million foreign currency loss for the year ended December 31, 2013. Foreign currency gains and losses are primarily related to the effect of currency fluctuations on monetary assets net of liabilities held by our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than US dollars.<br>
 <br>
Income Taxes.  We recorded no income tax expense or benefit for the year ended December 31, 2014.  For the year ended December 31, 2013 we recorded an income tax benefit of $49.7 million primarily related to the impairment of long lived assets during the year.</p>
