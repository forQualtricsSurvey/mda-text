<p>Other Income (Expense):<br>
 <br>
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt<br>
 <br>
We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $39.8 million in 2014 as compared to a loss on extinguishment of debt of $109.1 million in 2013. Loss on extinguishment of debt during 2014 included:</p>

<p>•<br>
Holders of our 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 converted approximately $24.9 million principal amount of these notes into 45.5 million shares of common stock, resulting in a non-cash loss on extinguishment of debt of $44.1 million. The fair value of the shares issued to these holders exceeded the derivative liability and principal amount written off due to the conversions, resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt.</p>

<p>•<br>
On April 15, 2014 we met the condition for automatic conversion of our 8.00% Notes Issued in 2009. As a result of this automatic conversion and other conversions prior to April 15, 2014, the remaining principal amount of 8.00% Notes Issued in 2009 converted into 47.1 million shares of common stock resulting in a non-cash gain on extinguishment of debt of $4.3 million. The derivative liability and principal amount written off exceeded the fair value of shares issued to the holders upon conversion, resulting in a gain on extinguishment of debt.</p>

<p>Loss on extinguishment of debt during 2013 included:</p>

<p>•<br>
In May 2013 we entered into the Exchange Agreement (as defined below) with the holders of approximately 91.5% of our outstanding 5.75% Notes. The Exchanging Note Holders (as defined below) received a combination of cash, shares of our common stock and 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013. We redeemed the remaining 5.75% Notes for cash in an amount equal to their outstanding principal amount. As a result of the exchange and redemption, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $47.2 million in 2013, representing the difference between the net carrying amount of the old 5.75% Notes and the fair value of consideration given in the exchange (including the new 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013, cash payments to both Exchanging and non-Exchanging Note Holders, equity issued to the Exchanging Note Holders and fees incurred in connection with the exchange).</p>

<p>•<br>
Holders of our 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 converted approximately $8.0 million principal amount of these notes into 14.9 million shares of common stock, resulting in a non-cash gain on extinguishment of debt of $4.2 million. The derivative liability and principal amount written off exceeded the fair value of shares issued to the holders upon conversion resulting in a gain on extinguishment of debt.<br>
 <br>
•<br>
In July 2013, we entered into an amended and restated Loan Agreement with Thermo. As a result of the amendment and restatement, we recorded a non-cash loss on extinguishment of debt of $66.1 million, representing the difference between the fair value of the indebtedness under the Loan Agreement, as amended and restated, and its carrying value just prior to amendment and restatement.</p>

<p>Loss on Equity Issuance<br>
 <br>
We had a non-cash loss on equity issuance of $16.7 million in 2013 resulting from the following transactions. Similar charges did not occur in 2014.</p>

<p>•<br>
In May and October 2013, we entered into Common Stock Purchase Agreements with Thermo. As a result of issuing stock under these agreements during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, we recognized $2.4 million and $16.4 million, respectively, of non-cash losses on the sale of shares representing the difference between the sale price of our common stock sold to Thermo and its fair value on the date of each sale (measured as the closing stock price on the date of each sale).</p>

<p>•<br>
In July 2013, a holder of our 5.0% Warrants exercised warrants in a net share exercise. The fair value of the common stock issued with respect to this exercise was recorded as a loss on equity issuance of $0.3 million, representing the fair value of the stock issued on the date the warrant was exercised.<br>
 <br>
Interest Income and Expense<br>
 <br>
Interest income and expense, net, decreased by $24.6 million to $43.2 million in 2014 from $67.8 million in 2013. During 2013 all of our 5.0% Notes converted into shares of our common stock. The total expense recorded in 2013 as a result of these conversions was $29.3 million. We recorded a beneficial conversion feature in connection with the issuance of the 5.0% Notes; when an instrument with a beneficial conversion feature is converted prior to the full accretion of the debt discounts, the unamortized discounts are recorded as interest expense. See Note 3: Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements in our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Similar charges did not occur in 2014.<br>
 <br>
The decrease in interest expense during 2014 is also due to a decrease in our outstanding debt balance in 2014 as compared to 2013, which was driven primarily by conversion of a portion of our indebtedness. As discussed in Note 3: Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements in our Consolidated Financial Statements, this conversion activity included the remaining 5.0% Notes in November 2013, the remaining 8.00% Notes Issued in 2009 in April 2014, and a portion of the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 at various dates throughout 2013 and 2014.</p>

<p>Items that have caused an increase to interest expense during 2014 include a reduction in our capitalized interest due to the decline in our construction in progress balance. As we placed satellites into service throughout 2013, our construction in progress balance related to our second-generation satellites decreased, which reduced the amount of interest we can capitalize under GAAP. As a result of this decrease in our construction in progress balance, we recorded approximately $36.9 million in interest expense during 2014 compared to $28.2 million in 2013.</p>

<p>Additionally, beginning on May 20, 2014, the first anniversary of the issuance of the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013, the holders had a right to receive make-whole interest payments upon conversion of these notes into common stock. The note conversions during 2014 have resulted in approximately $3.1 million of additional interest expense due to make-whole interest payments made upon conversion.<br>
 <br>
Derivative Gain (Loss)<br>
 <br>
Non-cash derivative losses decreased by $20.0 million to a loss of $286.0 million in 2014 compared to a non-cash loss of $306.0 million in 2013. We recognize gains or losses due to the change in the value of certain embedded features within our debt instruments that require standalone derivative accounting. These fluctuations are due primarily to changes in our stock price, which is one of the most significant drivers for the change in value of these derivative instruments, as well as other inputs used in our valuation models.  See Part II, Item 5. Market for Registrant&#x27;s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for the changes in our stock price at the balance sheet dates in 2014 and 2013.<br>
 <br>
Other<br>
 <br>
Other income (expense) fluctuated by $6.0 million to income of $3.0 million in 2014 from an expense of $3.0 million in 2013. Changes in other income (expense) are due primarily to non-cash foreign currency gains and losses recognized during the respective periods. Furthermore, in May 2014 Hughes exercised its right to receive the pre-payment of certain payment milestones in the form of our common stock at a 7% discount to market value in lieu of cash. In valuing the shares, we recorded a non-cash loss of approximately $0.7 million in other expense in our consolidated statement of operations during the second quarter of 2014.</p>

<p>In addition to foreign currency losses recognized during 2013, a $1.0 million non-cash loss was recorded as a result of issuing stock to Hughes in the fourth quarter of 2013 (see Note 6: Commitments in our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion) and a $0.6 million loss was recorded related to an equity method investment in 2013.</p>
