<p>New Accounting Pronouncements</p>

<p>In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), (“ASU 2014-09”). The purpose of ASU 2014-09 is to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and create a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2014-09 affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (for example, insurance contracts or lease contracts). The following subsequent Accounting Standards Updates either clarified or revised guidance set forth in ASU 2014-09:<br>
 <br>
•<br>
In August 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, (“ASU 2015-14”). ASU 2015-14 deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09. The guidance in ASU 2014-09 is now effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.<br>
 <br>
•<br>
In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenues Gross versus Net), (“ASU 2016-08”). The purpose of ASU 2016-08 is to clarify the implementation of revenue recognition guidance for principal versus agent considerations.<br>
 <br>
•<br>
In April 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, (“ASU 2016-10”). The purpose of ASU 2016-10 is to clarify certain aspects of identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation guidance.<br>
 <br>
•<br>
In May 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, (“ASU 2016-12”). The purpose of ASU 2016-12 is to address certain narrow aspects of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606 including assessing collectability, presentation of sales taxes, noncash considerations, contract modifications and completed contracts at transition.<br>
 <br>
•<br>
In December 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (“ASU 2016-20”). The purpose of ASU 2016-20 is to amend certain narrow aspects of the guidance issued in ASU 2014-09 related to the disclosure of performance obligations, as well as other amendments related to loan guarantee fees, contract costs, refund liabilities, advertising costs and the clarification of certain examples.</p>

<p>See Critical Accounting Policies/Impact of Recent Accounting Developments for summary of impact of this standard and its amendments.</p>

<p>In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), (“ASU 2016-02”). The purpose of ASU 2016-02 is to provide financial statement users a better understanding of the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 will result in the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for most operating leases. New disclosure requirements include qualitative and quantitative information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. ASU 2016-02 requires a modified retrospective transition by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the guidance is effective with the option to elect certain practical expedients. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements. The most significant impact of the amendments in ASU 2016-02 will be the recognition of new right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for assets currently subject to operating leases. We will adopt the amendments in ASU 2016-02 in the first quarter of 2019.</p>

<p>In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, (“ASU 2016-09”). The purpose of ASU 2016-09 is to simplify the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification of such activity on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that year. Prospective, retrospective, or modified retrospective application may be used dependent on the specific requirements of the amendments within ASU 2016-09. Effective January 1, 2017, we adopted ASU 2016-09 on a prospective basis (see Note 3). As such, prior periods have not been adjusted.</p>

<p>In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments – a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force, (“ASU 2016-15”). The purpose of ASU 2016-15 is to reduce the diversity in practice regarding how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year. A retrospective transition method should be used in the application of the amendments within ASU 2016-15. Early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, we will reclassify $9,519 of cash payments recorded in loss on debt amendments and refinancing from operating activities to financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016.  We do not expect ASU 2016-15 to have any other material impact on our consolidated financial statements.<br>
In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-04, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, (“ASU 2017-04”). The purpose of ASU 2017-04 is to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by removing the second step of the two-step impairment test. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis. ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that year. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We adopted the amendments in ASU 2017-04 during the second quarter of 2017 in order to reduce the complexity of performing its goodwill impairment tests. As discussed in Note 1, these tests are generally performed in the fourth quarter of each year. ASU 2017-04 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.</p>

<p>In May 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-09, Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope Modification Accounting, (“ASU 2017-09”). The amendments in ASU 2017-09 provide guidance on which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting as described in ASC Topic 718. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis. ASU 2017-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect ASU 2017-09 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.</p>

<p>In August 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, (“ASU 2017-12”). The amendments in ASU 2017-12 improve the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better reflect the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements. Additionally, the amendments in ASU 2017-12 simplify certain steps of applying hedge accounting guidance. ASU 2017-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect ASU 2017-12 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.</p>
