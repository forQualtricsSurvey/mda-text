<p>Seasonality</p>

<p>Our revenues have historically been seasonal, coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors. Generally, the most successful motion pictures have been released during the summer, extending from May to July, and during the holiday season, extending from early November through year-end. The unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can alter this seasonality trend. The timing and quality of such film releases can have a significant effect on our results of operations, and the results of one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next quarter or for the same period in the following year.</p>
