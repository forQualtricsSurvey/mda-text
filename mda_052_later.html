<p>Facility Agreement<br>
 <br>
On August 7, 2015, we entered into a Second Global Amendment and Restatement Agreement (the &quot;2015 GARA&quot;) providing for the amendment and restatement of our former senior credit facility and certain related credit documents (this amended and restated senior secured credit facility agreement is herein referred to as the &quot;Facility Agreement&quot;). The indebtedness under the Facility Agreement is scheduled to mature in December 2022. As of December 31, 2015, we had fully drawn all funds available under the Facility Agreement. Semi-annual principal repayments began in December 2014. See Note 3: Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements in our Consolidated Financial Statements.</p>

<p>The Facility Agreement contains customary events of default and requires that we satisfy various financial and non-financial covenants. Pursuant to the terms of the Facility Agreement, until 2019 we may cure noncompliance with certain financial covenants through Equity Cure Contributions (as described below). If we violate any of these covenants and are unable to obtain a sufficient Equity Cure Contribution or a waiver, we would be in default under the Facility Agreement, and the lenders could accelerate payment of the indebtedness. The acceleration of our indebtedness under one agreement may permit acceleration of indebtedness under other agreements that contain cross-acceleration provisions. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with respect to the covenants of the Facility Agreement.</p>

<p>The compliance calculations of the financial covenants of the Facility Agreement permit inclusion of certain cash funds contributed to us from the issuance of our common stock and/or subordinated indebtedness. We refer to these funds as &quot;Equity Cure Contributions&quot; and we may obtain them to achieve compliance with financial covenants, subject to the conditions set forth in the Facility Agreement. Each Equity Cure Contribution must be in a minimum amount of $10 million for each measurement period or in the aggregate for all periods until the date that such funding is no longer allowed by the Facility Agreement. In February and June 2015, we drew $10 million and $14 million, respectively, under our agreement with Terrapin, as described below. We deemed these funds to be Equity Cure Contributions under the Facility Agreement and treated them accordingly in our calculation of compliance with certain financial covenants for the measurement periods ended December 31, 2014 and June 30, 2015. In August 2015 and February 2016, we drew $15 million and $6.5 million, respectively, under the August 2015 Terrapin Agreement. We used a portion of these funds as an Equity Cure Contribution under the Facility Agreement in the calculation of financial covenants for the measurement period ended December 31, 2015.</p>

<p>The Facility Agreement requires that we maintain a total of $37.9 million in a debt service reserve account which is pledged to secure all of our obligations under the Facility Agreement. We may use these funds only to make principal and interest payments under the Facility Agreement. As of December 31, 2015, the balance in the debt service reserve account, which was established with the proceeds of the loan agreement with Thermo discussed below, was $37.9 million and classified as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets.</p>

<p>The 2015 GARA amended the Facility Agreement to, among other things, clarify the definition of Net Debt and the calculation of the Net Debt to Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA covenant, change the way in which certain Equity Cure Contributions are calculated, and extend by up to two years the date through which we may utilize Equity Cure Contributions. The Facility Agreement bears interest at a floating rate of LIBOR plus 2.75% through June 2017, increasing by an additional 0.5% each year thereafter to a maximum rate of LIBOR plus 5.75%. Ninety-five percent of our obligations under the Facility Agreement are guaranteed by COFACE, the French export credit agency. Our obligations under the Facility Agreement are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by all of our domestic subsidiaries and are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets and our domestic subsidiaries (other than their FCC licenses), including patents and trademarks, 100% of the equity of our domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the equity of certain foreign subsidiaries.  See discussion in Note 3: Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements in our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the 2015 GARA.</p>
