<p>Other Income (Expense):<br>
 <br>
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt<br>
 <br>
We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.3 million in 2015 compared to $39.8 million in 2014.</p>

<p>Loss on extinguishment of debt during 2015 included:</p>

<p>•<br>
Holders of $6.5 million principal amount of 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 converted their notes into our common stock, resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.3 million on the issuance of 10.9 million shares of voting common stock. The fair value of the shares issued to these holders exceeded the derivative liability and principal amount written off due to the conversions, resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt.</p>

<p>Loss on extinguishment of debt during 2014 included:</p>

<p>•<br>
Holders of our 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 converted approximately $24.9 million principal amount of these notes, resulting in the issuance of 46.4 million shares of common stock and a non-cash loss on extinguishment of debt of $44.1 million. The fair value of the shares issued to these holders exceeded the derivative liability and principal amount written off due to the conversions, resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt.</p>

<p>•<br>
On April 15, 2014 we met the condition for automatic conversion of our 8.00% Notes Issued in 2009. During 2014, as a result of this automatic conversion and other conversions prior to April 15, 2014, holders of our 8.00% Notes Issued in 2009 converted approximately $51.7 million principal amount of these notes into 47.1 million shares of common stock, resulting in a non-cash gain on extinguishment of debt of $4.3 million. The derivative liability and principal amount written off exceeded the fair value of shares issued to the holders upon conversion, resulting in a gain on extinguishment of debt.</p>

<p>Loss on Equity Issuance<br>
 <br>
Loss on equity issuance was $6.7 million during 2015 and $0.7 million during 2014.</p>

<p>In June 2015, Hughes exercised its right to receive a pre-payment of certain payment milestones in shares of our common stock at a 7% discount to market value in lieu of cash. In valuing the shares issued to Hughes at the 7% discount, we recorded a non-cash loss of approximately $1.2 million in loss on equity issuance in our consolidated statements of operations. In conjunction with this agreement, we also provided Hughes downside protection through March 31, 2016. This agreement generally would require us to issue additional shares to Hughes if the market value of our common stock at the end of the downside protection period is less than the price at issuance. We recorded an additional $5.5 million loss on equity issuance during 2015 based on an estimate of the value of this option calculated using a Black-Scholes pricing model. We mark this liability to market at each balance sheet date and through the settlement date.</p>

<p>During the second quarter of 2014, Hughes also exercised its right to receive a pre-payment of certain milestone payments in shares of our common stock at a 7% discount to market value in lieu of cash. We recorded a loss of $0.7 million related to this discount in our consolidated statements of operations.</p>

<p>Interest Income and Expense<br>
 <br>
Interest income and expense, net, decreased $7.3 million to an expense of $35.9 million for 2015 compared to an expense of $43.2 million for 2014. This decrease resulted primarily from interest expense of approximately $4.0 million related to make-whole interest we paid to holders who converted 8.00% Notes Issued in 2009 and 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 during 2014, compared to $0.6 million of make-whole interest paid to converting holders during 2015. A decrease in our outstanding debt balance and an increase in capitalized interest also contributed to the decrease in interest expense for the year. See Note 3: Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements to our Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the reduction in our outstanding debt balance, including conversions of the remaining 8.00% Notes Issued in 2009 in April 2014 and a portion of the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 at various dates throughout 2014 and 2015.<br>
 <br>
Derivative Gain (Loss)<br>
 <br>
Derivative gain (loss) fluctuated by $467.9 million to a gain of $181.9 million in 2015 compared to a loss of $286.0 million in 2014. We recognize gains or losses due to the change in the value of certain embedded features within our debt instruments that require standalone derivative accounting. Fluctuations in our stock price are the most significant cause for the change in value of these derivative instruments.  Our stock price fluctuated significantly during 2015 and 2014, resulting in material non-cash derivative gains and losses in these periods. See Note 5: Fair Value Measurements to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the fair value computations of our derivatives. <br>
 <br>
Other<br>
 <br>
Other income decreased by $0.6 million to $3.2 million in 2015 from $3.8 million in 2014. Changes in other income (expense) are due primarily to foreign currency gains and losses recognized during the respective periods. The U.S. dollar has strengthened significantly since mid-2014 relative to certain other currencies, including the Euro and Canadian dollar. Given the significant financial statement amounts we have denominated in these currencies, the foreign currency gain decreased by $0.4 million to $3.7 million in 2015 compared to $4.1 million in 2014.</p>

<p>We recorded a foreign currency gain during 2015 notwithstanding a $1.9 million loss related to our Venezuelan subsidiary. Effective July 1, 2015, we began using the SIMADI exchange rate published by the Central Bank of Venezuela to remeasure our Venezuelan subsidiary&#x27;s Bolivar based transactions and net monetary assets in U.S. dollars. We determined, based upon our specific facts and circumstances, that the SIMADI rate is the most appropriate rate for financial reporting purposes, instead of the official exchange rate we previously used.</p>
