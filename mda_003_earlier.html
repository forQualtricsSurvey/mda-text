<p>The LME price of primary aluminum has continued a downward trend since 2011. Low LME prices, high inventory levels, high power costs and surplus production have increased the pressure on marginal, high-cost producers to close unprofitable smelters. We are beginning to see the impacts of these challenging market conditions for marginal primary aluminum producers. Outside of China, many producers have begun curtailing unprofitable production and delayed investment in expansion and greenfield projects. Primary aluminum production in the United States and North America in 2013 decreased approximately 10% and 6%, respectively, from 2012 levels. This pattern is not unique to North America; these same trends are evident in Europe as well. We believe that the list of announced smelter closures and industry bankruptcies will continue to grow if the underlying market fundamentals mentioned above do not improve.</p>

<p>The average LME price for primary aluminum for 2013 was $1,846 per tonne. The average LME price in 2013 was down from $2,020 per tonne in 2012 and $2,398 per tonne in 2011. Demand for aluminum products continued to improve in 2013 with some growth in Asia and other developing economies, continued improvement in the U.S. and some early signs of growth in Europe. China continued to experience strong growth in aluminum consumption, albeit at a slower pace of growth; in addition, overcapacity in China offset some of the increase in demand. In addition, aluminum inventories remain at historically high levels, which may put downward pressure on aluminum prices.</p>

<p>In addition to the LME price, we receive regional delivery premiums and product premiums for value-added products (including high-purity and billet products). We receive these regional delivery premiums for our aluminum products in the U.S. Midwest and EU. Recently, these regional delivery premiums have surged to historically high levels due to a number of factors, including aluminum financing transactions. In the near term, higher regional delivery premiums help balance the impact of the low LME pricing, but there can be no assurance how long these high regional delivery premiums will last.</p>

<p>Much of the primary aluminum held in LME warehouses currently serves as collateral for financing transactions and is thus not available to the market. The economic attractiveness of aluminum financing transactions is influenced by many factors. Any change that reduces the attractiveness of these primary aluminum financing transactions, such as an increase in interest rates, a flattening of the forward curve for primary aluminum or increases in warehouse rents, could result in a dramatic increase in the outflow of metal from these warehouses, which may further depress the LME prices or premiums. It is not possible to predict how long the current LME warehouse conditions will continue. Recently, the LME announced reforms to their warehouse load out rules effective April 1, 2014, which are expected to reduce warehouse queue times and increase the outflow of primary aluminum into the market. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors – New LME warehousing rules could cause aluminum prices to decrease.”</p>
