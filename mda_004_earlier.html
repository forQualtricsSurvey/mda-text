<p>Century Sebree enters into an agreement for market-based power</p>

<p>Effective February 1, 2014, Century Sebree began purchasing market-based electrical power for the Sebree smelter under new agreements with Big Rivers and Kenergy. Under the new arrangement, the power companies will purchase power on the open market and resell it to Sebree at MISO pricing plus transmission and other costs incurred by them. The definitive contracts with Big Rivers and Kenergy were approved by the KPSC on January 30, 2014.</p>

<p>As a result of the decision by the KPSC, we rescinded the WARN notice issued by Sebree in November 2013. The WARN notice had specified that the plant would be curtailed unless Century Sebree gained access to competitively priced power.</p>

<p>CAKY enters an agreement for market-based power for Hawesville; Conditional WARN notice at Hawesville remains in place</p>

<p>Effective August 20, 2013, CAKY began purchasing market-based electrical power for the Hawesville smelter under new agreements with Big Rivers and Kenergy. Under the new arrangement, the power companies will purchase power on the open market and resell it to Hawesville at MISO pricing plus transmission and other costs incurred by them. The definitive contracts with Big Rivers and Kenergy were approved by the KPSC on August 14, 2013; however, there are still significant regulatory and transmission issues that remain unresolved with respect to the new power supply arrangement at Hawesville. CAKY could curtail all smelter operations if these issues are not ultimately resolved. CAKY has kept in place a conditional WARN notice to the employees at the Hawesville smelter that has been extended through March 31, 2014 given the potential plant curtailment. See Part I Item 1A - Risk Factors - “If we are unable to successfully finalize the new power arrangement at our Hawesville smelter, we will curtail this facility” for a discussion of risks related to the Hawesville power agreement.</p>

In November 2013, the total prepaid amount of approximately $9.5 million was credited against taxes due in 2013.</p>

<p>The purchase price for the acquisition was $61 million (subject to customary working capital adjustments), of which we have paid approximately $48 million as of December 31, 2013. The remaining portion of the purchase price, if any, will be paid following final determination of the applicable working capital adjustments. As part of the transaction, RTA retained all historical environmental liabilities of the Sebree smelter and fully funded the pension plan assumed by Century in accordance with the purchase agreement.</p>

<p>Century Aluminum of West Virginia reaches agreement with PBGC for future pension contributions</p>

<p>In April 2013, we entered into a settlement agreement with the PBGC regarding an alleged “cessation of operations” at our Ravenswood facility as a result of the curtailment of operations at the facility. While we do not believe that a “cessation of operations” has occurred, we have reached an agreement with the PBGC to resolve the matter. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we will make additional contributions (above any minimum required contributions) to our defined benefit pension plans totaling approximately $17.4 million over the term of the agreement, which runs through 2016. In 2013, we made contributions pursuant to this agreement of approximately $6.7 million. Under certain circumstances, in periods of low primary aluminum prices relative to our operations, we may defer one or more of these payments, but we would be required to provide the PBGC with acceptable security for any deferred payments.</p>

<p>Century receives arbitration ruling in Kruger lawsuit</p>

<p>In December 2013, we received a ruling in the arbitration of a lawsuit filed by our former Chief Executive Officer, Logan Kruger. In the lawsuit, Mr. Kruger alleged that Century had breached the employment and severance protection agreements between Century and Mr. Kruger and that Century was obligated to make various severance payments to him in excess of $20 million. In its ruling, the arbitration panel awarded Mr. Kruger approximately $8.7 million in severance payments, plus accrued interest, but rejected Mr. Kruger’s claims for further severance payments and held that Mr. Kruger had forfeited all of his outstanding incentive awards upon his resignation from Century. We recorded a net charge of approximately $8.4 million in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013.</p>
