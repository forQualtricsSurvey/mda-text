<p>Liquidity and Capital Resources</p>

<p>Operating Activities</p>

<p>We primarily collect our revenues in cash, mainly through box office receipts and the sale of concessions. In addition, nearly all of our theatres also provide the patron a choice of using a credit card, debit card or advanced-sale type certificates such as a gift card. Because our revenues are received in cash prior to the payment of related expenses, we have an operating “float” and historically have not required traditional working capital financing. Cash provided by operating activities amounted to $454.6 million, $455.9 million and $451.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.</p>
