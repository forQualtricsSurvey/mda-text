<p>Liquidity and Capital Resources<br>
 <br>
Our principal liquidity requirements include paying amounts related to second-generation upgrades to our ground infrastructure, repaying our debt and funding our operating costs. Our principal sources of liquidity include cash on hand, cash flows from operations and funds available under the equity line agreement with Terrapin. See below for further discussion. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for a description of risks, some of which are beyond our control, affecting our ability to achieve our liquidity requirements.<br>
Additionally, the Facility Agreement requires us to maintain $37.9 million in a debt service reserve account. The Facility Agreement restricts the use of the funds in this account to making principal and interest payments under the Facility Agreement. As of December 31, 2014, the balance in the debt service reserve account was $37.9 million and classified as restricted cash.<br>
 <br>
Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012<br>
 <br>
The following table shows our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for 2014, 2013 and 2012 (in thousands):</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>Cash Flows Used in Operating Activities<br>
 <br>
Net cash provided by operating activities during 2014 was $4.0 million compared to net cash used in operating activities during 2013 of $6.5 million. We experienced favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities during 2014, which resulted in more cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared to 2013. Compared to the same period in 2013, net cash provided by operating activities fluctuated by $10.5 million, which was due primarily to an increase in cash collected from accounts receivable, cash receipts for future services to be provided by us to our subscribers and cash receipts from the sale of inventory.<br>
 <br>
Net cash used in operating activities during 2013 was $6.5 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities during 2012 of $6.9 million. During 2013, we used cash from operating activities to reduce certain accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Compared to the same period in 2012, net cash provided by (used in) operating activities fluctuated by $13.3 million, which was due primarily to a $6.0 million refund received in the third quarter of 2012 related to the termination of a contingent agreement with a potential vendor for services related to our second-generation constellation.<br>
  <br>
Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities<br>
 <br>
Cash used in investing activities was $19.3 million during 2014 compared to $37.1 million during 2013. The decrease in cash used in investing activities of $17.8 million was due primarily to a decrease in costs related to our second-generation constellation and ground upgrades. Our payments related to the construction of our second-generation satellites decreased in 2014 as they were deployed fully by August 2013. We expect to continue to incur capital expenditures relating to the upgrade of our gateways and other ground facilities.</p>

<p>Cash used in investing activities was $37.1 million during 2013 compared to $58.0 million during 2012. The decrease in cash used in investing activities of $20.9 million was due primarily to a fluctuation in our restricted cash balance as well as a decrease in costs related to our second-generation constellation and ground upgrades. During 2013, we drew $8.8 million of excess funds held in our debt service reserve account to pay launch related expenses. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was also due to decreased payments related to the construction of our second-generation satellites as they were deployed fully by August 2013.<br>
 <br>
Cash Flows Provided by Financing Activities<br>
 <br>
Net cash provided by financing activities was $5.3 million in 2014 compared to $49.0 million in 2013. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities of $43.7 million during 2014 was due primarily to net proceeds in 2013 of $25.8 million related to the extinguishment of the 5.75% Notes and the issuance of equity to Thermo in connection with the Consent Agreement and the Common Stock Purchase and Option Agreement. Similar transactions did not recur in 2014. During 2013, we also drew the remaining amount under our Facility Agreement and the interest earned from amounts held in our contingent equity account. The total drawn from these accounts totaled $1.7 million. We also received cash for other issuances of shares and through warrants exercised. As a result of these transactions, we received $15.4 million in 2013 and $9.5 million in 2014. We also drew $6.0 million from our equity line agreement with Terrapin in 2013 and $0 in 2014. These decreases in cash provided by financing activities were coupled by the first principal payment pursuant to our Facility Agreement of $4.0 million, which was paid in 2014. See below and Note 3: Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements in our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these items.</p>

<p>Net cash provided by financing activities was $49.0 million in 2013 compared to $52.4 million in 2012. The fluctuation in cash provided by financing activities of $3.4 million during 2013 was due primarily to transactions related to our debt instruments and equity commitments. In May 2013, we exchanged our 5.75% Notes for new 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013. In connection with this exchange, we paid $20.0 million in cash as a reduction of principal outstanding. We also received $65.0 million in equity from Thermo pursuant to the Consent Agreement and the Common Stock Purchase and Option Agreement. We also made payments for financing costs associated with this exchange and the amendment and restatement of our Facility Agreement in August 2013. See Note 3: Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements in our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.<br>
 <br>
During 2013, we also drew the remaining amount under our Facility Agreement and the interest earned from amounts held in our contingent equity account. The total drawn from these accounts totaled $1.7 million whereas we drew $53.2 million from these accounts during 2012. We also received cash for the issuance of shares through warrants exercised, funds received from shares issued to Terrapin and the cancellation of our 2008 Share Lending Agreement. As a result of these transactions, we received $21.4 million.</p>
