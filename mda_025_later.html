<p>Foreign Exchange</p>

<p>Management does not believe that the fluctuation in the value of the dollar in relation to the currencies of its customers in the last three fiscal years has adversely affected the Company’s ability to sell products at agreed upon prices denominated in U.S. dollars. No assurance can be given, however, that adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations will not occur in the future. Should adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations occur in geographies where the Company sells/exports its products, management is not certain such fluctuations will or will not materially impact the Company’s operating results.</p>

<p>Inflation</p>

<p>Management believes inflation has not had a significant impact on the Company’s operations during the past three years. For example, raw material prices have remained essentially flat during the course of 2014 and are not expected to increase significantly in 2015. Looking further out as global economies grow, particularly in China and India, we expect long-term upward pressure on supply demands of raw materials and will cause continual inflationary pressures throughout 2016 and 2017.</p>
