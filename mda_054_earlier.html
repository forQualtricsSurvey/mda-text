<p>8.00% Convertible Senior Notes Issued in 2013<br>
 <br>
On May 20, 2013, we entered into an Exchange Agreement with the beneficial owners and investment managers for beneficial owners (the &quot;Exchanging Note Holders&quot;) of approximately 91.5% of our outstanding 5.75% Notes and completed the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, we issued $54.6 million aggregate principal amount of 8.00% Convertible Senior Notes (the &quot;8.00% Notes Issued in 2013&quot;) to the Exchanging Note Holders. The 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of $0.80 per share of common stock, or 1,250 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013, subject to adjustment as provided in the Fourth Supplemental Indenture between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee, dated May 20, 2013 (the &quot;New Indenture&quot;). The conversion price of the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 will be adjusted in the event of certain stock splits or extraordinary share distributions, or as a reset of the base conversion and exercise price as described below.<br>
 <br>
The 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 are senior unsecured debt obligations. There is no sinking fund for the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013. The 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 will mature on April 1, 2028, subject to various call and put features as described below, and bear interest at a rate of 8.00% per annum. Interest on the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing on October 1, 2013. Interest is paid in cash at a rate of 5.75% per annum and through issuance of additional 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 at a rate of 2.25% per annum.<br>
 <br>
Subject to certain conditions set forth in the New Indenture, including prior approval of the Majority Lenders (as defined in the Facility Agreement), we may redeem the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013, in whole or in part, at any time on or after April 1, 2018, at a price equal to the principal amount of the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 to be redeemed plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon.<br>
 <br>
A holder of 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 has the right, at the Holder’s option, to require us to purchase some or all of the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 on each of April 1, 2018 and April 1, 2023 at a price equal to the principal amount of the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 to be purchased plus accrued and unpaid interest.<br>
 <br>
A holder of the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 has the right, at the holder’s option, to require us to purchase some or all of the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 at any time if there is a Fundamental Change. A Fundamental Change occurs if our common stock ceases to be traded on a stock exchange or an established over-the-counter market or if there is a change of control. If there is a Fundamental Change, the purchase price of any 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 purchased by us will be equal to its principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and a Fundamental Change Make-Whole Amount calculated as provided in the New Indenture.<br>
 <br>
Subject to the procedures for conversion and other terms and conditions of the New Indenture, a holder may convert its 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 at its option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding April 1, 2028, into shares of common stock (or, at our option, cash in lieu of all or a portion thereof, provided that, under the Facility Agreement, we may pay cash only with the consent of the Majority Lenders). Upon conversion, the holder will be entitled to receive shares of common stock, cash or a combination thereof (provided that, under the Facility Agreement, we may pay cash only with the consent of the Majority Lenders), in such amounts and subject to terms and conditions set forth in the New Indenture. We will pay cash in lieu of fractional shares otherwise issuable upon conversion of the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 as specified in the Indenture.<br>
 <br>
Through December 31, 2014, a total of $32.9 million principal amount of 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 had been converted, resulting in the issuance of approximately 60.3 million shares of voting common stock relating to the special conversions as well as other conversions pursuant to the terms of the New Indenture. <br>
 <br>
The base conversion rate is adjustable on April 1, 2015 based on the average price of our common stock in the 30-day period ending on that date. If the base conversion rate is adjusted April 1, 2015, we also will provide additional consideration to the holders of the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 in an amount equal to 25% of the principal amount of the outstanding 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013, payable in equity or cash at our election (provided, under the Facility Agreement, that we may pay cash only with the consent of the Majority Lenders). That consideration will not reduce the principal amount of the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 or any interest otherwise payable on the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013.<br>
 <br>
The New Indenture also provides for other customary adjustments of the base conversion rate, including upon our sale of additional equity securities at a price below the then applicable conversion price. If a 8.00% Note Issued in 2013 is converted after May 20, 2014, the holder will receive additional shares of common stock as a make-whole premium equal to the first three years of interest on the notes (i.e., 24% of the notes less any interest already paid through the date of the conversion) as provided in the New Indenture. Due to our common stock issuances since May 20, 2013, the base conversion rate had been reduced to $0.73 per share of common stock as of December 31, 2014.</p>

<p>The New Indenture provides for customary events of default. If there is an event of default, the Trustee may, at the direction of the holders of 25% or more in aggregate principal amount of the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013, accelerate the maturity of the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013. As of December 31, 2014, we were not in default under the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 .<br>

<p>5.0% Convertible Senior Notes<br>
 <br>
In June 2011, we issued $38.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 5.0% Convertible Senior Unsecured Notes (the “5.0% Notes”) and warrants (the “5.0% Warrants”) to purchase 15.2 million shares of our voting common stock. The 5.0% Notes were convertible into shares of common stock at an initial conversion price of $1.25 per share of common stock, or 800 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 5.0% Notes, subject to adjustment in the manner set forth in the Indenture. The 5.0% Notes were guaranteed on a subordinated basis by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries, on an unconditional joint and several basis, pursuant to a Guaranty Agreement. The 5.0% Warrants are exercisable until five years after their issuance. The 5.0% Notes and 5.0% Warrants have anti-dilution protection in the event of certain stock splits or extraordinary share distributions, and provided for a reset of the conversion and exercise price on April 15, 2013 if our common stock were below the initial conversion and exercise price at that time. On April 15, 2013, the base conversion rate for the 5.0% Notes and the exercise price of the 5.0% Warrants were reset to $0.50 and $0.32, respectively.<br>
 <br>
The 5.0% Notes were senior unsecured debt obligations and ranked pari passu with our 8.00% Notes Issued in 2009 and our existing 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 and were subordinated to our obligations pursuant to our Facility Agreement. There was no sinking fund for the 5.0% Notes. The 5.0% Notes were scheduled to mature at the earlier to occur of (i) December 14, 2021, or (ii) six months following the maturity date of the Facility Agreement and bore interest at a rate of 5.0% per annum. Interest on the notes was paid in-kind semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year. Under certain circumstances, interest on the 5.0% Notes may have been payable in cash at the election of the holder if such payments are permitted under the Facility Agreement.<br>
 <br>
Pursuant to the terms of the 5.0% Notes Indenture, if, at any time on or after June 14, 2013 and on or prior to Stated Maturity, the closing price of the Globalstar’s common stock exceeded two hundred percent of the conversion price then in effect for at least 30 consecutive trading days, then, at our option, all 5.0% Notes then outstanding were to convert automatically into shares of common stock. The conditions for the automatic conversion were met, and we elected to convert all outstanding 5.0% Notes into shares of common stock on November 7, 2013.<br>
 <br>
Prior to November 7, 2013, approximately $17.5 million principal amount of 5.0% Notes had been converted resulting in the issuance of 41.1 million shares of our common stock and 7.2 million 5.0% Warrants had been exercised, which resulted in our issuing 6.7 million shares of common stock and receiving $2.0 million in cash. On November 7, 2013, approximately $24.2 million, representing the remaining principal amount of 5.0% Notes plus paid in kind interest added to the principal amount of the 5.0% Notes, of 5.0% Notes were converted, resulting in the issuance of 51.9 million shares of our common stock. 5.0% Warrants to purchase eight million shares of common stock were outstanding as of December 31, 2014.</p>

<p>See Note 3: Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements in our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the 5.0% Convertible Senior Unsecured Notes and warrants.<br>
 <br>
 8.00% Convertible Senior Unsecured Notes Issued in 2009<br>
 <br>
In June 2009, we sold $55.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.00% Convertible Senior Unsecured Notes (the “8.00% Notes Issued in 2009”) and Warrants (the “8.00% Warrants”) to purchase 15.3 million shares of our common stock. The 8.00% Notes Issued in 2009 were subordinated to all of our obligations under the Facility Agreement. The 8.00% Notes Issued in 2009 were senior unsecured debt obligations and, except as described in the preceding sentence, ranked pari passu with our existing unsecured, unsubordinated obligations, including our 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013. The 8.00% Notes Issued in 2009 were to mature at the later of the tenth anniversary of closing (June 19, 2019) or six months following the maturity date of the Facility Agreement and bore interest at a rate of 8.00% per annum. Interest on the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2009 was payable in the form of additional 8.00% Notes Issued in 2009 or, subject to certain restrictions, in common stock at the option of the holder. Interest was payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year.<br>
 <br>
The 8.00% Warrants had full ratchet anti-dilution protection, and the exercise price of the Warrants was subject to adjustment under certain other circumstances. The exercise period for the 8.00% Warrants began on December 19, 2009 and ended on June 19, 2014. Prior to expiration of the 8.00% Warrants, the exercise price of the 8.00% Warrants was $0.32. As a result of the expiration of the exercise period on June 19, 2014, all outstanding 8.00% Warrants were exercised during the second quarter of 2014, resulting in the issuance of 38.2 million shares of our common stock.  Holders of the 8.00% Warrants had the right to exercise on either a cash or cashless basis. We received approximately $7.5 million in cash as a result of these exercises.<br>
 <br>
Pursuant to the terms of the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2009, if, at any time the closing price of our common stock exceeded 200% of the conversion price of the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2009 then in effect for 30 consecutive trading days, all of the outstanding 8.00% Notes Issued in 2009 were to be automatically converted into common stock. The condition for the automatic conversion was met on April 15, 2014, and all outstanding 8.00% Notes Issued in 2009 (approximately $37.8 million principal amount at that time) converted on that date into approximately 34.5 million shares of our voting common stock. Prior to the automatic conversion of the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2009, the base conversion price of the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2009 was $1.14.</p>
