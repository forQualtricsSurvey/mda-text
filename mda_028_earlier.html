<p>Revenues and Expenses</p>

<p>We generate revenues primarily from filmed entertainment box office receipts and concession sales with additional revenues from screen advertising sales and other revenue streams, such as vendor marketing promotions, meeting rentals and electronic video games located in some of our theatres. Our relationship with NCM has assisted us in expanding our offerings to domestic advertisers and broadening ancillary revenue sources. We also offer alternative entertainment, such as live and pre-recorded sports programs, concert events, the Metropolitan Opera, in-theatre gaming and other special events in our theatres through our joint venture, AC JV, LLC. Our Flix Media initiative has also allowed us to expand our screen advertising and alternative content within our international circuit and to other international exhibitors.</p>

<p>Films leading the box office during the year ended December 31, 2016 included the carryover of the December 2015 release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens and the 2016 releases of Finding Dory, Captain America: Civil War, The Secret Life Of Pets, The Jungle Book, Deadpool, Zootopia, Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice, Suicide Squad, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Moana, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and Sing, among other films. Films scheduled for release during 2017 include well-known franchise films such as Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Beauty and the Beast, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Justice League, Spider Man: Homecoming, Despicable Me 3, Thor: Ragnarok, The Fate of the Furious, Wonder Woman, and The Lego Batman Movie, among other films.</p>

<p>Film rental costs are variable in nature and fluctuate with our admissions revenues. Film rental costs as a percentage of revenues are generally higher for periods in which more blockbuster films are released. Advertising costs, which are expensed as incurred, are primarily fixed at the theatre level.</p>

<p>Concession supplies expense is variable in nature and fluctuates with our concession revenues. We purchase concession supplies to replace units sold. We negotiate prices for concession supplies directly with concession vendors and manufacturers to obtain volume rates.</p>

<p>Although salaries and wages include a fixed cost component (i.e. the minimum staffing costs to operate a theatre facility during non-peak periods), salaries and wages move in relation to revenues as theatre staffing is adjusted to respond to changes in attendance. In some international locations, staffing levels are also subject to local regulations.</p>

<p>Facility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment. Certain of our leases are subject to percentage rent only while others are subject to percentage rent in addition to their fixed monthly rent if a target annual revenue level is achieved. Facility lease expense as a percentage of revenues is also affected by the number of theatres under operating leases, the number of theatres under capital leases and the number of fee-owned theatres.</p>

<p>Utilities and other costs include both fixed and variable costs and primarily include utilities, expenses for projection and sound equipment maintenance and monitoring, property taxes, janitorial costs, repairs and maintenance and security services.</p>
