<p>Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2011</p>

<p>Net sales: Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased $84.3 million to $1,272.1 million. Lower price realizations for primary aluminum in the year ended December 31, 2012, contributed $196.9 million to the sales decrease. The monthly average LME cash price for 2012 was down 16% from the monthly average LME cash price in 2011. Higher net sales volume had a year over year positive impact of $112.6 million. Direct shipments increased 42,425 tonnes from the same period in 2011 due to the restart of curtailed capacity and improvements in operations at Hawesville and the increase in direct sales from Grundartangi. Toll shipments increased 1,962 tonnes from the same period in 2011.</p>

<p>Gross profit: During 2012, lower price realizations, net of LME based alumina and power cost decreases, reduced gross profit by $138.1 million. Higher shipment volume contributed $1.3 million to the increase in gross profit. Offsetting the gross profit reduction of $136.8 million described above were $54.0 million in net cost decreases comprised of: reduced costs for power and natural gas at our U.S. smelters, $6.3 million; reduced costs for maintenance, supplies and materials, $31.3 million; other cost reductions, $14.1 million; offset by higher depreciation charges, $0.6 million; and a charge of $2.9 million in 2011 related to an insurance recovery that went into litigation.</p>

<p>Our operating costs in 2011 were negatively impacted by the costs related to the restart of idled capacity at the Hawesville facility and the instability of operations at the plant for a majority of the year. The absence of those costs in 2012 had a favorable impact on gross profit and their impact is included in the amounts reported above.</p>

<p>A decline in LME prices at the end of 2011 resulted in a decline in the market value of our inventory below its cost basis, resulting in charges to cost of goods sold of $19.8 million in 2011. At the end of 2012, the market value of our inventory was greater than its cost basis; adjustments to the lower of cost or market inventory reserve reversed the $19.8 million reserve through cost of goods sold in 2012. On a year to year comparative basis, this positively impacted the change in gross profit by $39.6 million.</p>

<p>Other operating expense (income) - net:  Other operating expense (income) - net is primarily related to items associated with Ravenswood. In addition to the on-going costs at the curtailed facility, in 2012, we increased our estimate of accrued litigation liabilities. In 2011, we recorded net benefits of $18.3 million resulting from the elimination of medical benefits for retirees of Ravenswood.</p>

<p>Selling, general and administrative expenses: During 2012, we incurred general and administrative charges related to the integration of the Century Vlissingen anode facility into our business. During 2012, litigation expenditures related to Helguvik were lower than in 2011. In addition, as part of the Helguvik arbitration decision, we were reimbursed for a portion of those expenditures in 2012. During 2011, we recorded charges of $7.7 million related to the contractual impact of changes in our Board of Directors and executive management team; these charges did not repeat in 2012.</p>

<p>Net gain (loss) on forward and derivative contracts:  The net gain (loss) on forward and derivative contracts in 2012 and 2011 relates primarily to marking-to-market and recording settlements of option contracts that were put in place to provide partial downside price protection for our domestic facilities. At the end of 2012, all of these option contracts had been settled.</p>

<p>Other income (expense) - net: During 2012, Grundartangi received a $7.9 million settlement payment for the costs to repair a transformer damaged in transit, a related business interruption claim, interest and other fees associated with the claim.</p>

<p>Income tax expense: Our 2012 and 2011 income tax expense was primarily driven by our earnings in Iceland. In addition, during 2011, we had a partial offset to income tax expense due to a discrete tax benefit arising from the elimination of medical benefits for retirees of the Ravenswood facility.</p>
