<p>Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets</p>

<p>We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be fully recoverable. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and has allocated goodwill to the reporting unit based on an estimate of its relative fair value. Management considers the reporting unit to be each of its nineteen regions in the U.S. and nine countries internationally with Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala considered one reporting unit (the Company does not have goodwill recorded for all of its international locations). Goodwill impairment was evaluated using a two-step approach during 2014, requiring us to compute the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed to measure the potential goodwill impairment. Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value. Management’s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples. Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was eight times for the evaluations performed during 2014. As of December 31, 2014, the estimated fair value of our goodwill exceeded their carrying values by more than 10%.</p>

<p>For the year ended December 31, 2015, we performed a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment on all reporting units except one, in accordance with ASU 2011-08 Testing Goodwill for Impairment (“ASU 2011-08”). The qualitative assessment included consideration of historical and expected future industry performance, estimated future performance of the Company, current industry trading multiples and other economic factors. Based on the qualitative assessment performed, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units were less than their carrying values. We performed the quantitative two-step approach on a new U.S. region that had not previously been assessed for goodwill impairment. The fair value for the new reporting unit was determined based on a multiple of estimated cash flows, which was eight times, and exceeded its carrying value by more than 10%.</p>

<p>For the year ended December 31, 2016, we performed a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment on all reporting units. Based on the qualitative assessment performed, the Company determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units were less than their carrying values.</p>

<p>Tradename intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. During 2014, we estimated the fair value of our tradenames by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of our tradename to forecasted future revenues, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, the tradename intangible asset is written down to its estimated fair value. Significant judgment is involved in estimating market royalty rates and long-term revenue forecasts. Management’s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected revenue performance and industry trends. As of December 31, 2014, the estimated fair value of the Company’s tradename intangible assets exceeded their carrying values by more than 10%.</p>

<p>For the year ended December 31, 2015, we performed a qualitative tradename intangible asset impairment assessment in accordance with ASU 2011-08. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we performed a qualitative assessment for all indefinite-lived tradename assets other than our tradename in Ecuador, for which we performed a quantitative assessment. The qualitative assessments included consideration of the Company’s historical and forecasted revenues and estimated royalty rates for each tradename intangible asset. Based on the qualitative assessments performed, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of tradename intangible assets were less than their carrying values as of December 31, 2015 and 2016. Our quantitative test for our tradename in Ecuador included estimating the fair value of the tradename based on forecasted revenues for our Ecuador theatres multiplied by an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of the tradename, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties. As of December 31, 2016, the estimated fair value of our tradename in Ecuador exceeded its carrying value by more than 10%.</p>

<p>For the year ended December 31, 2016, we also performed a test on our definite-lived tradename associated with the Rave theatres acquired in 2013. We recently rebranded certain of these theatres with Cinemark signage as part of recliner conversions and other renovations. We estimated the fair value of the Rave tradename by applying an estimated market royalty rate that could be charged for the use of the tradename to forecasted future revenues for the theatres using the Rave tradename, with an adjustment for the present value of such royalties. As of December 31, 2016, the estimated fair value of our Rave tradename intangible asset exceeded their carrying value by more than 10%.</p>
