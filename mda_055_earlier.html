<p>Terrapin Opportunity, L.P. Common Stock Purchase Agreement<br>
 <br>
On December 28, 2012 we entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement with Terrapin pursuant to which we may, subject to certain conditions, require Terrapin to purchase up to $30.0 million of shares of our voting common stock over the 24-month term following the effective date of a resale registration statement, which became effective on August 2, 2013. This type of arrangement is sometimes referred to as a committed equity line financing facility. From time to time over the 24-month term, and in our sole discretion, we may present Terrapin with up to 36 draw down notices requiring Terrapin to purchase a specified dollar amount of shares of our voting common stock. We will not sell Terrapin a number of shares of voting common stock which, when aggregated with all other shares of voting common stock then beneficially owned by Terrapin and its affiliates, would result in the beneficial ownership by Terrapin or any of its affiliates of more than 9.9% of our then issued and outstanding shares of voting common stock.<br>
 <br>
As of December 31, 2014, Terrapin had purchased a total of 6.1 million shares of voting common stock at a purchase price of $6.0 million. In February 2015, we drew $10.0 million under our agreement with Terrapin, which amount was an Equity Cure Contribution under the terms of the Facility Agreement, and issued 4.5 million shares of voting common stock to Terrapin at an average price of $2.22 per share. We anticipate that we will make additional draws under the Terrapin Agreement during 2015 to achieve compliance with our financial covenants under the Facility Agreement.</p>
