<p>We intend to finance our future recurring capital expenditures from available cash, our cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. For major investment projects, such as the Helguvik project, we would likely seek financing from various capital and loan markets and may potentially pursue the formation of strategic alliances. We may be unable to issue additional debt or equity securities, or enter into other financing arrangements on attractive terms, or at all, due to a number of factors including a lack of demand, unfavorable pricing, poor economic conditions, unfavorable interest rates, or our financial condition or credit rating at the time. Future uncertainty in the U.S. and international markets and economies may adversely affect our liquidity, our ability to access the debt or capital markets and our financial condition.</p>

<p>Capital expenditures for 2013 were $68.1 million, of which $24.1 million was related to the Grundartangi expansion project and $18.2 million was related to the Century Vlissingen restart. The remaining amounts are related to upgrading production equipment, improving facilities and complying with environmental requirements. We believe capital spending in 2014, excluding any expansion of the current production capacity at Century Vlissingen, will be approximately $50 million.</p>

<p>On June 1, 2013, we acquired the Sebree aluminum smelter from a subsidiary of RTA. The purchase price for the acquisition was $61 million (subject to customary working capital adjustments), of which we have paid approximately $48 million as of December 31, 2013. The remaining portion of the purchase price, if any, will be paid following final determination of the applicable working capital adjustments. We are working with RTA to resolve our disagreement relating to the working capital amount in accordance with the procedures set forth in the purchase agreement. We expect the matter to be resolved in the second quarter of 2014. The transaction was funded with available cash on hand. See Note 2 Acquisition of Sebree aluminum smelter to the consolidated financial statements contained herein for additional information.</p>

<p>In order to restart the first 75,000 tonnes of annual anode capacity at Century Vlissingen, we made approximately $18.2 million in capital expenditures during 2013 and expect to make an additional $10.2 million in 2014. The first 75,000 tonnes of capacity was restarted in late 2013 and will provide an anode supply to Grundartangi to replace third-party anode supply contracts that terminated in 2013. We have an option to increase production capacity to 150,000 tonnes when we conclude it is feasible and advantageous to do so.</p>

<p>We have made and continue to make capital expenditures for the construction and development of our Helguvik project. We have substantial future contractual commitments for the Helguvik project. If we were to cancel the Helguvik project, we estimate that our exposure to contract cancellation costs would be approximately $20 million, of which we currently have accrued liabilities of approximately $12.8 million. We are continuing to negotiate with the power suppliers to the project to, among other things, remove all the remaining conditions to their obligations to supply contracted power. The timing of the power availability together with other factors will determine the timing of resumption of major construction activity at Helguvik. We expect that capital expenditures for this project will be less than $0.5 million per year until the restart of major construction activities. We cannot, at this time, predict when the restart of major construction activity will occur. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors — Construction at our Helguvik smelter site has been significantly curtailed.  Substantial delay in the completion of this project may increase its cost, subject us to losses and impose other risks to completion that are not foreseeable at this time” included herein.</p>
