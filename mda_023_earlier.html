<p>Liquidity and Capital Resources</p>

<p>The Company used $6,214 of cash in operating activities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 as compared to generating $40,424 in the same period of the prior year.</p>

<p>Net income of $33,932, non-cash depreciation, amortization of intangibles, other assets and discounted future liabilities generated $19,617 as compared to $17,230 in the prior year. Finally stock based compensation of $3,379 and loss from equity method investment of $986 and change in value of deferred income taxes of $2,523 provided a net cash inflow of $60,437 as compared to $55,499 for the same period of 2012.</p>

<p>As of December 31, 2013, our working capital has increased to $139,007 as compared to $108,647 as of December 31, 2012. This increase was mainly driven by increased inventory levels offset by increased levels of programs and deferred revenues. Inventories ended the year at $139,830, as compared to $87,951 at December 31, 2012. Following adverse weather in key states and at key times of the year driving growers to make late changes in crop planting to crops requiring shorter growing seasons such as soybeans, for which uses the Company does not offer products, elevated channel inventories caused a slowdown in demand at the end of the season. This resulted in the Company retaining higher than expected inventories on hand at the end of the year ahead of the start of the new growing season. It should also be noted that the Company purchases and holds raw material, intermediate or finished goods inventory from time to time based on a single annual purchase from a single source or supplier, potentially resulting in peaks in the carrying value of raw materials. Furthermore, in order to achieve efficient manufacturing runs, the Company may manufacture a particular product only one time a year and then carry high levels of that inventory for a period. Finally, it is a feature of the industry that inventory is carried in anticipation of demand from the market as a result of specific pest pressure or weather conditions, on time schedules that could not accommodate either a purchasing or manufacturing process.</p>

<p>Our program accruals have ended higher than at the end of the prior year reflecting primarily the mix of business that has driven the financial performance for 2013 including higher sales of certain programs that, for market reasons, carry higher program liabilities. As a result, accrued program costs are up 66% from $32,335 at December 31, 2012 to $53,630 at December 31, 2013.</p>

<p>A significant factor in our cash performance in 2013 has been the need to respond to market demand for products sold exclusively in our proprietary delivery systems including Smartbox®. Demand has increased to such a degree that in 2013, we have made further increases in our inventory of long lived packaging supplies. These are treated as other assets and amortized over expected lives of between 2 and 10 years. These items increased by $16,940 during 2013.</p>

<p>The Company used $18,947 in investing activities in the twelve months to December 31, 2013 as compared to $21,101 in the same period of 2012. This year we have spent $15,260 on fixed assets primarily focused on continuing to invest in manufacturing infrastructure in support of our growing sales, and $3,687 on investments.</p>

<p>Our financing activities utilized net cash of $7,123 in 2013 as compared to using $16,429 in 2012. The main uses were to pay $4,804 in dividends as we continue our newly implemented quarterly dividend, $1,934 in repurchasing of common stock in the market place following the decision to begin a program aimed at offsetting dilution caused by incentive compensation, and the payment of other notes payable and long-term liabilities primarily associated with liabilities under deferred purchase agreements on product acquisitions in the amount of $7,985. The Company received $2,050 from the exercise of stock options and the sales of common stock under its ESPP plan (including associated tax benefits) as compared to $3,848 for the same period of last year. Finally, the Company increased net borrowings under its senior secured credit facility in the amount of $5,550 as compared to reducing borrowings by $8,443 in the year ended December 31, 2012.</p>

<p>The Company has various loans in place that together constitute the short-term and long-term loan balances shown in the balance sheet as at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012. These are summarized in the following table:</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>On June 17, 2013, AMVAC Chemical Corporation (“AMVAC”), our principal operating subsidiary, as borrower, and affiliates (including the Company), as guarantors and/or borrowers, entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “New Credit Agreement”) with a group of commercial lenders led by Bank of the West (AMVAC’s primary bank) as agent, swing line lender and L/C issuer. The New Credit Agreement supersedes the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (“First Amendment”) dated as of January 10, 2011 and more fully described in the Company’s Form 8-K filed on January 13, 2011. The New Credit Agreement is a senior secured lending facility with a five year term and consists of a revolving line of credit of $200 million and an accordion feature for up to $100 million. The new facility includes both AMVAC CV and AMVAC BV as borrowers. In connection with AMVAC’s entering into the New Credit Agreement, all outstanding indebtedness under the First Amendment was rolled over into the New Credit Agreement, and term loans were converted into revolving debt. Under the New Credit Agreement, revolving loans bear interest at a variable rate based, at borrower’s election with proper notice, on either (i) LIBOR plus the “Applicable Rate” which is based upon the Consolidated Funded Debt Ratio (“Eurocurrency Rate Loan”) or (ii) the greater of (x) the Prime Rate, (y) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5%, and (z) the Daily One-Month LIBOR Rate plus 1.00%, plus, in the case of (x), (y) or (z) the Applicable Rate (“Alternate Base Rate Loan”). Interest payments for Eurocurrency Rate Loans are payable on the last day of each interest period (either one, two, three or six months, as selected by the borrower) and the maturity date, while interest payments for Alternate Base Rate Loans are payable on the last business day of each month and the maturity date. The senior secured revolving line of credit matures on June 17, 2018.</p>

<p>The Company uses a pay fixed, receive 1Month LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) interest rate swap to manage the interest expense generated by variable rate debt. At December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company had in place an interest rate swap, the use of which results in a fixed interest rate of 3.39% for the portion of variable rate debt that is covered by the interest rate swap contract. The current interest rate swap contract was put in place on March 30, 2011 and terminates on December 31, 2014. The table below shows the amount of outstanding debt and the related notional amount on the interest rate swap contract at each of the balance sheet dates:</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>Under the New Credit Agreement, the Company has three key covenants (with which it was in compliance throughout the year and as of December 31, 2013). The covenants are as follows: (1) the Company must maintain its borrowings below a certain consolidated funded debt ratio, (2) the Company has a limitation on its annual spending on the acquisition of fixed asset capital additions, and (3) the Company must maintain a certain consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio.</p>

<p>At December 31, 2013 total indebtedness was $51,745 as compared to $52,443 at December 31, 2012. At December 31, 2013, based on its performance against the most restrictive covenants listed above, the Company had the capacity to increase its borrowings by up to $148,450 under the credit facility agreement.<br>
Substantially all of the Company’s assets are pledged as collateral with its banks.</p>

<p>The Company’s main bank is Bank of the West, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the French bank, BNP Paribas. Bank of the West has been the Company’s bank for more than 30 years. Bank of the West is the syndication manager for the Company’s loans and acts as the counterparty on the Company’s derivative transactions.</p>
