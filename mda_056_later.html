<p>Warrants Outstanding<br>
 <br>
Warrants are outstanding to purchase shares of our common stock as shown in the table below:</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>(1)<br>
Pursuant to the terms of the Contingent Equity Agreement with Thermo (See Note 9: Related Party Transactions in our Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete description of the Contingent Equity Agreement), we issued to Thermo warrants to purchase shares of common stock pursuant to the annual availability fee and subsequent reset provisions in the Contingent Equity Agreement. These warrants are exercisable for five years from issuance. We originally issued these warrants between June 2009 and June 2012, and the exercise periods related to the remaining unexercised warrants will expire at various dates through June 2017.<br>
(2)<br>
In June 2011, we issued warrants (the “5.0% Warrants”) to purchase 15.2 million shares of our voting common stock in connection with the issuance of our 5.0% Convertible Senior Unsecured Notes. During 2013, the holders of a portion of the 5.0% Warrants exercised them to purchase 7.2 million shares of common stock. The remaining 5.0% Warrants are exercisable until June 2016. See Note 3: Long-Term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements in the Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete description of the 5.0% Warrants.</p>
