<p>Comparison of the Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014<br>
 <br>
Revenue:<br>
 <br>
During 2015, total revenue increased $0.4 million to $90.5 million from $90.1 million in 2014. This increase was due primarily to a $4.3 million increase in service revenue, which is attributable to growth in our subscriber base. This increase in service revenue was offset partially by a $3.9 million decline in revenue generated from subscriber equipment sales, which resulted primarily from lower selling prices of our Duplex phones and SPOT units ahead of the transition to second-generation products. Additionally, during 2015 movement of foreign exchange rates significantly burdened total revenue. Due to our global footprint, we generate a significant portion of our sales in foreign currencies. Total revenue would have been approximately $4.6 million higher during the year ended December 31, 2015 if there had been no change in foreign exchange rates from the year ended December 31, 2014.<br>

<p>(1)<br>
In 2014 we initiated a process to deactivate certain subscribers in our Duplex subscriber base who were either suspended or non-paying. We deactivated approximately 26,000 subscribers during the first quarter of 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2014, excluding these 26,000 deactivated subscribers from prior period metrics, average subscribers would have been 62,433 and ARPU would have been $36.03.</p>

<p>For 2015 gross Duplex and SPOT subscriber additions were approximately 24,385 and 73,323, respectively. For 2014 gross Duplex and SPOT subscriber additions were approximately 18,773 and 61,670, respectively. Because our Simplex subscribers are able to activate and deactivate their units several times during the year, gross Simplex subscriber additions are not considered to be a meaningful metric.</p>

<p>The numbers reported in the table above are subject to immaterial rounding inherent in calculating averages.</p>

<p>Other service revenue includes revenue generated from engineering services and third party sources, which are not subscriber driven. Accordingly, we do not present average subscribers or ARPU for other service revenue in the table above.<br>
 <br>
Service Revenue<br>
 <br>
Duplex service revenue increased $0.4 million in 2015. The Duplex subscriber base increased 14% from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. The increase in service revenue generated from subscriber growth was offset partially by a decrease in ARPU (adjusted for the mass deactivations in 2014 as described above). Changes in the rate plans selected by our subscribers and the negative impact from the appreciation of the U.S. dollar caused this 2015 decrease in ARPU. In 2015 the movement of foreign exchange rates decreased Duplex service revenue by $2.3 million.<br>
 <br>
SPOT service revenue increased 15% in 2015. SPOT ARPU increased 5% driven primarily by the significant number of SPOT Gen3TM sales over the past 12 months. We sell SPOT Gen3TM with a higher annual rate plan compared to other SPOT products. SPOT subscribers increased 11% from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. Expansion in international markets and a corresponding increase in activations are the principal reasons for growth in our SPOT subscriber base.</p>

<p>Simplex service revenue increased 8% in 2015 due to a 14% increase in average Simplex subscribers during 2015, offset partially by a 5% decrease in ARPU due to the various competitive pricing plans we offer to our Simplex customers.<br>
 <br>
Other revenue decreased $1.0 million, or 23%, in 2015. The decrease in other revenue is due primarily to lower revenue generated from government contracts as well as a decrease in third party revenue. While we were manufacturing and deploying our second-generation constellation, we began purchasing service from other satellite providers that we re-sell to certain loyal customers to maintain the customer relationship. We record this revenue in other service revenue as third party revenue. In markets where our coverage is fully restored, we have transitioned these subscribers to our network.<br>
 <br>
Equipment Revenue<br>
 <br>
Revenue from Duplex equipment sales decreased 21% in 2015. Although there was a 14% increase in the Duplex subscriber base from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015, Duplex equipment sales revenue declined due to a reduction in the selling price of our phones beginning in early 2015 in advance of the introduction of second-generation products, which we expect in 2016. Reduced Duplex equipment pricing has contributed to the 48% increase in the number of phones sold during 2015.</p>

<p>Revenue from SPOT equipment sales decreased 19% in 2015 primarily as a result of the success of our recent rebate programs. The rebates reduced equipment revenue, but contributed to the increase in SPOT service revenue by increasing our subscriber count. The success of our SPOT products continues to grow as evidenced in part by improving consumer velocity, which we measure by the number of subscriber activations.<br>
 <br>
Revenue from Simplex equipment sales decreased 19% in 2015. This decrease is due to product mix as we sold a larger number of high margin units in 2014 and a larger number of low margin units in 2015.</p>

<p>Total equipment revenue would have been approximately $1.2 million higher during 2015 if there had been no change in foreign exchange rates from 2014.</p>
