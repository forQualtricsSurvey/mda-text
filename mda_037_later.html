<p>Investing Activities</p>

<p>Our investing activities have been principally related to the development, remodel and acquisition of theatres. New theatre openings, remodels and acquisitions historically have been financed with internally generated cash and by debt financing, including borrowings under our senior secured credit facility. Cash used for investing activities amounted to $328.1 million, $327.8 million and $410.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. The increases in cash used for investing activities during 2017 was primarily due to increased capital expenditures and increased theatre acquisitions.</p>

<p>Capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017 were as follows (in millions):</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>(1)<br>
The amount for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes approximately $26.3 million for the purchase of our corporate headquarters building in Plano, TX.  The amounts for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 include approximately $3.9 and $9.4 million, respectively, for the remodel of our corporate headquarters building.<br>
Capital expenditures for existing theatres in the table above includes the costs of remodeling certain of our existing properties to include Luxury Loungers and expanded concession offerings, which began during 2015.  During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017, we had an average of 33, 89 and 148 of our domestic screens, respectively, temporarily closed for such remodels.</p>

<p>Our U.S. theatre circuit consisted of 339 theatres with 4,561 screens as of December 31, 2017. We built three new theatres and 26 screens, acquired one theatre with twelve screens and closed four theatres with 36 screens during the year ended December 31, 2017.  At December 31, 2017, we had signed commitments to open seven new theatres and 72 screens in domestic markets during 2018 and open six new theatres with 64 screens subsequent to 2018. We estimate the remaining capital expenditures for the development of these 136 domestic screens will be approximately $98 million.</p>

<p>Our international theatre circuit consisted of 194 theatres with 1,398 screens as of December 31, 2017. We built five new theatres and 40 screens and acquired two theatres with 14 screens during the year ended December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017, we had signed commitments to open ten new theatres and 55 screens in international markets during 2018 and open one theatre and six screens subsequent to 2018. We estimate the remaining capital expenditures for the development of these 61 international screens will be approximately $41 million.</p>

<p>Actual expenditures for continued theatre development, remodels and acquisitions are subject to change based upon the availability of attractive opportunities.  We plan to fund capital expenditures for our continued development with cash flow from operations, borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, and proceeds from debt issuances, sale leaseback transactions and/or sales of excess real estate.</p>
