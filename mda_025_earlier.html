<p>Foreign Exchange</p>

<p>Management does not believe that the fluctuation in the value of the dollar in relation to the currencies of its customers in the last three fiscal years has adversely affected the Company’s ability to sell products at agreed upon prices denominated in U.S. dollars. No assurance can be given, however, that adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations will not occur in the future. Should adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations occur in geographies where the Company sells/exports its products, management is not certain such fluctuations will or will not materially impact the Company’s operating results.</p>

<p>Inflation</p>

<p>Management believes inflation has not had a significant impact on the Company’s operations during the past three years. However, raw material prices have increased approximately 1% during the course of 2013 and are expected to continue to increase during 2014 and beyond due to the growth in global economies, particularly in China and India. This growth will put further pressure on supply demands of raw materials and will cause continual inflationary pressures to throughout 2014 and 2015.</p>
