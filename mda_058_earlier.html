<p>Contractual Obligations and Commitments<br>
 <br>
Contractual obligations at December 31, 2014 are as follows (in thousands):</p>

<p>[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]</p>

<p>(1)<br>
Amounts include payment in kind interest (“PIK”), which is shown as due in the year the underlying debt is due.</p>

<p>The maturity date of the 8.00% Convertible Senior Notes Issued in 2013 (the “8.00% Notes Issued in 2013”) is April 1, 2028; however the holders of these notes can require us to purchase any or all of the notes at par in cash on April 1, 2018. For purposes of this schedule, these notes are shown as due in 2018 as a result of this put option. The table above does not consider other potential conversions as we cannot predict the amount, if any, of the notes that may be converted.</p>

<p>(2)<br>
Amounts include projected interest payments to be made in cash. Debt outstanding under our Facility Agreement bears interest at a floating rate and, accordingly, we estimated our interest costs in future periods. Amounts also include projected cash interest to be paid on the 8.00% Notes Issued in 2013 through the first put date of April 1, 2018.</p>

<p>(3)<br>
We have purchase commitments with Thales, Ericsson, and Hughes related to the procurement, deployment and maintenance of our second-generation network. Amounts in the table above exclude estimated accrued interest of approximately $0.4 million at December 31, 2014, on amounts owed to Ericsson on amounts previously due under the agreement.</p>

<p>(4)<br>
In June 2012, we settled our prior commercial disputes with Thales, including those disputes that were the subject of an arbitration award, for €17,530,000. This amount represented one-third of the termination charges awarded to Thales in the arbitration. The payment is due on the later of the effective date of the new contract for the purchase of additional second-generation satellites and the occurrence of the effective date of the financing for the purchase of these satellites and the first draw from the financing. We included this amount in 2015 above, although the timing of any payment is indefinite and undeterminable. For purposes of the table above, we converted the termination charge to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2014. See Note 7: Contingencies in our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.</p>

<p>(5)<br>
In connection with our acquisition of Axonn in 2009, we are obligated to pay contingent consideration in stock for earnouts based on sales of existing and new products over a five-year earnout period ending December 31, 2014. The amount above is the final stock payment based on sales of certain products during the fourth quarter of 2014.</p>

<p>See Note 6: Commitments in our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our contractual obligations.</p>
